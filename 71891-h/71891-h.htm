  <p>The Platyhelminthes, or Flat Worms, form a natural assemblage of animals, the members of which,
  however widely they may differ in appearance, habits, or life-history, exhibit a fundamental
  similarity of organisation which justifies their separation from other classes of worms, and their
  union into a distinct phylum. Excluding the leeches (Hirudinea), and the long sea-worms
  (Nemertinea)&mdash;which, though formerly included, are now treated independently&mdash;the
  Platyhelminthes may be divided into three branches: (1) Turbellaria (including the Planarians),
  (2) Trematoda (including the liver-flukes), and (3) Cestoda (tape-worms). The Mesozoa will be
  treated as an appendix to the Platyhelminthes.</p>

  <p>The Turbellaria were so called by Ehrenberg<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (1831)
  on account of the cilia or vibratile processes with which these aquatic animals are covered,
  causing by their incessant action, tiny currents ("turbellae," disturbances) in the surrounding
  water. The ciliary covering distinguishes this free-living group from the parasitic Trematodes and
  Cestodes, some of which possess such an investment, but only during their early free <span
  class="pagenum" id="page4"><span class="smaller">{4}</span></span>larval stage, for the short
  period when they have left the parental host and are seeking another (Figs. 26, 27, 42).</p>

  <p>Some Turbellaria (Rhabdocoelida) resemble Infusoria in their minute size, shape, and movements.
  Nevertheless they possess an organisation of considerable complexity. The fresh-water Planarians
  (Fig. 14), abounding in ponds and streams, vary from a quarter to half an inch in length, and are
  elongated and flattened. Their body is soft, and progresses by a characteristic, even, gliding
  motion like a snail. The marine Planarians or Polyclads (Fig. 8) are usually broad and leaf-like,
  sometimes attaining a length of six inches, and swim or creep in a most graceful way. Land
  Planarians occur in this country (Fig. 15), but far more abundantly in tropical and sub-tropical
  districts, in moist places, venturing abroad at night in pursuit of prey. They are elongated and
  cylindrical, in some cases measuring, when fully extended, a foot or more in length, and are often
  ornamented with brilliantly coloured, longitudinal bands.</p>

  <p>Turbellaria are carnivorous, overpowering their prey by peculiar cutaneous offensive weapons,
  and then sucking out the contents of the victim by the "pharynx." Land Planarians feed on
  earthworms, molluscs, and wood-lice; fresh-water Planarians on Oligochaet worms, water-snails, and
  water-beetles; marine forms devour Polychaet worms and molluscs. Some Turbellaria seem to prefer
  freshly-killed or weakly examples of animals too large to be overpowered when fully active.
  Certain Rhabdocoelida are messmates of Molluscs and Echinoderms, and a few others are truly
  parasitic&mdash;a mode of life adopted by all Trematodes save <i>Temnocephala</i>.</p>

  <p>The Trematodes<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> may be divided into those living on
  the outer surface of various aquatic animals, usually fish (Ectoparasites); and those which
  penetrate more or less deeply into the alimentary canal or the associated organs of the host
  (Endoparasites). They are oval, flattened Platyhelminthes ranging from a microscopic size to a
  length of three feet (<i>Nematobothrium</i>, Fig. 22), and are provided with organs of adhesion by
  which they cling to the outer surface, or to the interior, of the animals they inhabit. Trematodes
  occur parasitically in all groups of Vertebrates, but, with the exception of the liver-flukes of
  the sheep (<i>Distomum hepaticum</i> and <i>D. magnum</i>), and of <i>Bilharzia haematobia</i>
  found in man (in the blood-vessels of the urinary bladder) over the greater part <span
  class="pagenum" id="page5"><span class="smaller">{5}</span></span>of Africa, their attacks are not
  usually of a serious nature. Ectoparasitic Trematodes are <i>Monogenetic</i>; that is, their
  larvae grow up directly into mature forms. The Endoparasitic species, however, are usually
  <i>Digenetic</i>. Their larvae enter an Invertebrate and produce a new generation of different
  larvae, and these another. The last are immature flukes. They enter a second host, which is
  swallowed by the final Vertebrate host in which they become mature.</p>

  <p>The Cestodes or Tape-worms have undergone more profound modifications both in structure and in
  mode of development. They are all endoparasitic, and, with one exception (<i>Archigetes</i>),
  attain maturity solely within the alimentary canal of Vertebrates. In length they range from a few
  millimetres to several metres, but this great size is attained from the need for the rapid
  production and accumulation of enormous numbers of eggs. The "head" or "scolex" is attached to the
  mucous membrane of the host by suckers or hooks, but there is no mouth nor any certain trace of a
  digestive tract at any stage of the life-history of Cestodes. For nourishment they absorb, through
  the skin, the previously-digested food (of the host) that bathes them. In a few Cestodes the body
  is simple and not divided into "proglottides" or generative segments, but in most cases it is
  jointed in such a way that the last segment is the oldest, and each contains a set of reproductive
  organs. The life-histories of Cestodes are most remarkable. The proglottides containing the eggs
  pass out of the final host along with the faeces and enter the intermediate host with the food.
  The larvae hatch, and boring their way into the blood-vessels, are carried by the circulation to
  various internal organs. Here they usually become "bladder-worms," and develop the "head" of the
  future sexual form. Then, if, as is usually the case, the intermediate host is preyed upon by the
  final host, the larval Cestodes enter the alimentary canal of the latter. The head of the larva
  alone survives digestion, and from it the mature worm is formed.</p>

  <p>Of these three branches of the phylum Platyhelminthes, the Turbellaria possess features of
  special interest and importance. Not only do they furnish the explanation of the structure of the
  two parasitic groups (which have probably arisen from Turbellarian-like ancestors), but they
  occupy the lowest position in the whole group of worms. There are reasons for thinking that this
  is the simplest group of bilateral animals which adopt the habit of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page6"><span class="smaller">{6}</span></span>creeping. The Turbellaria are most closely
  allied to that great extinct group from which they, the Nemertinea, Rotifera, and even the
  Annelids, offer increasingly convincing evidence of having been derived. Many questions relating
  to the affinities of, or the origin of organs in, the Annelids, resolve themselves into similar
  questions about the Turbellaria. For these reasons, this group is here dealt with at greater
  length than the others, the interest of which is of a more special nature.</p>

  <p>The history of our knowledge of the Cestodes dates back to ancient times, as the presence and
  effects of tape-worms early attracted the attention of physicians. Trematodes are first distinctly
  referred to in the sixteenth century, while Turbellaria first figure in Trembley's memoir on Hydra
  (1744).<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The whole subject of the increase in our
  knowledge of parasitic Platyhelminthes is dealt with in the standard work, <i>The Parasites of
  Man</i>, by Leuckart,<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and a complete list of
  references in zoological literature to Cestodes and Trematodes is to be found in Bronn's
  <i>Thierreich</i>.<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> O. F. M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and Ehrenberg founded our knowledge of the Turbellaria, but for a
  long time the group remained in a most neglected condition. In this country Montagu, G. Johnston,
  and in Ireland, William Thompson, discovered several marine species, one of which, <i>Planocera
  folium</i> (from Berwick), has not again been met with on British shores. Dalyell<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> conducted classical researches on the habits of Planarians, and
  Faraday<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> made interesting experiments on their power
  of regenerating lost parts. The credit of assigning the correct interpretation to most of the
  various organs of fresh-water Planarians belongs to von Baer<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and Dug&egrave;s,<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> while
  Mertens<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> effected a similar service for the marine
  forms, or Polyclads. The minute Rhabdocoels were first successfully investigated and classified by
  Oscar Schmidt.<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The great work on this group is,
  however, the <span class="pagenum" id="page7"><span class="smaller">{7}</span></span>monograph by
  von Graff.<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> A similarly comprehensive and
  indispensable treatise by Lang, on the Polycladida,<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> contains references to all previous publications on the group,
  among which the papers by Quatrefages, Johannes M&uuml;ller, Keferstein, Minot, and Hallez stand out
  conspicuously. Moseley's work<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> on the Land
  Planarians of Ceylon is undoubtedly the most revolutionary paper referring to this group, and the
  best contribution towards elucidating the structure of the Tricladida at a time when the subject
  was very obscure. A monograph on Land Planarians is being prepared by von Graff.</p>

  <p>The Turbellaria are divided into: (1) <i>Polycladida</i>, marine forms with multiple intestinal
  branches; (2) <i>Tricladida</i>, marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial Planarians with three main
  intestinal branches; (3) the <i>Rhabdocoelida</i>, as varied in habit as the Triclads, but
  possessing a straight and simple or slightly lobed, intestine. A detailed description of an
  example of the Polyclads, and then a comparative account of each division, will now be given.</p>

  <p><b>Appearance and Habits.</b>&mdash;An account of the Polyclad Turbellaria may be fitly
  prefaced by a description of a very common representative, <i>Leptoplana tremellaris</i>, so
  called on account of the thin, flat body which executes when disturbed, quivering or tremulous
  swimming movements.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page8"><span class="smaller">{8}</span></span></div>

  <p>Like all Polyclads, <i>Leptoplana</i> is marine. It is probably found on all European shores,
  northwards to Greenland and southwards to the Red Sea, while vertically it ranges from the
  littoral zone down to fifty fathoms. There is, however, an apparently well-marked difference
  between the littoral specimens, which vary from three-quarters to one inch in length, are brownish
  in colour and firm in consistency, and the more delicate examples half an inch long, white with a
  brown tinge, which occur in deeper water.</p>

  <p>At low water <i>Leptoplana</i> may be found buried in mud or on the under surface of stones, in
  pools where darkness and dampness may be ensured till the return of the tide. It is, however, by
  no means easy to detect and remove it from the encrusting Polyzoa, Ascidians, or Sponges with
  which it is usually associated. The flat, soft, unsegmented body is so closely appressed to the
  substratum that its presence is usually only betrayed by its movement, an even gliding motion of
  the mobile body, which suggested the apt name "la pellicule anim&eacute;e" to Dicquemare. The creeping
  surface is called ventral, the upper one dorsal, and as the broader end of the body always goes
  first, it is anterior as opposed to the more pointed posterior extremity. With a lens the
  characters shown in Figs. 1 and 2 may be observed. The eyes are seen as black dots near the
  anterior end, and are placed at the sides of a clear oval space, the brain. Along the transparent
  margin of the body, the ends of the intestinal branches may be seen. These ramify from a lobed
  stomach or main-gut, and should the specimen be mature, the "uterus" loaded <span class="pagenum"
  id="page9"><span class="smaller">{9}</span></span>with eggs forms a dark margin round the latter
  (Figs. 1 and 2, <i>ut</i>). The ventral surface is whitish, and through it the "pharynx," a
  frilled protrusible structure, may be dimly observed. The "mouth,"<a id="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> through which the pharynx at the time of feeding is thrust out
  (Fig. 2, <i>mo</i>), is almost in the centre of the ventral surface. Behind this, a white,
  V-shaped mark (<i>vd</i>) indicates the ducts of the male reproductive organs, and still further
  back is the irregular opaque mark of the "shell-gland," by which the egg-shells are formed (Fig.
  2, &#x2640;).</p>

  <p><i>Leptoplana</i> employs two kinds of movement, creeping and swimming. Creeping is a uniform
  gliding movement, caused by the cilia of the ventral surface, aided perhaps by the longitudinal
  muscular layers of this surface, and is effected on the under side of the "surface-film" of water
  almost as well as on a solid substratum. Swimming is a more rapid and elegant movement, employed
  when alarmed or in pursuit of prey. The expanded fore-parts of the body act as lobes, which are
  flapped rapidly up over the body and then down beneath it, undulations running rapidly down them
  from before backwards. The action in fact is somewhat similar to that by which a skate swims, a
  resemblance pointed out long ago by Dug&egrave;s<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> (Fig.
  3).</p>

  <p>We have few direct observations on the nature of the food of <i>Leptoplana</i>, or the exact
  mode by which it is obtained. Dalyell,<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> who
  observed this species very carefully, noticed that it was nocturnal and fed upon a <i>Nereis</i>,
  becoming greatly distended and of a green colour after the meal, but pale after a long fast.
  Keferstein<a id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> noticed a specimen in the act of
  devouring a <i>Lumbriconereis</i> longer than itself, and also found the radulae of <i>Chiton</i>
  and Taenioglossate Molluscs in the intestine. That such an apparently weak and defenceless animal
  does overpower large and healthy Annelids and Mollusca, has not hitherto been definitely proved.
  Weak or diseased examples may be chiefly selected. The flexible <i>Leptoplana</i> adheres firmly
  to its prey, and the rapid action of the salivary glands of its mobile pharynx quickly softens and
  disintegrates the internal parts of the victim. The food passes into the stomach (Fig. 2,
  <i>mg</i>), and is there digested. It is then transferred to the lateral branches of the
  intestine, and, after all the nutritious matters have been absorbed, the faeces are ejected with a
  sudden contraction of the whole body through the pharynx into the water.</p>

  <p><i>Leptoplana</i> probably does not live more than a year. In the spring or summer, batches of
  eggs are laid and fixed to algae or stones by one individual, after having been fertilised by
  another. Young <i>Leptoplana</i> hatch out in two to three weeks, and lead a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page11"><span class="smaller">{11}</span></span>pelagic existence till they are three or four
  millimetres in length. In late summer, numbers of such immature examples may be found among
  sea-weeds and <i>Corallina</i> in tide pools. In the succeeding spring they develop first the male
  and then the female reproductive organs.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Anatomy of Leptoplana tremellaris.</b>&mdash;<i>Leptoplana</i> may be divided into
  corresponding halves only by a median vertical longitudinal plane. The body and all the systems of
  organs are strictly bilaterally symmetrical. Excepting the cavities of the organs themselves, the
  body is solid. A connective "parenchyma" (Fig. 4, <i>par</i>) knits the various internal organs
  together, while it allows free play of one part on another. These organs are enclosed in a
  muscular body-wall, clothed externally by the ciliated epidermis, which is separated from the
  underlying musculature by a strong membrane (Fig. 4, <i>bm</i>), the only skeletal element in the
  body.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page12"><span class="smaller">{12}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Body-Wall.</b>&mdash;The epidermis (Fig. 4, <i>ep</i>) is composed of a single layer of
  ciliated cells, containing small, highly refractive, pointed rods or "rhabdites" (<i>rh</i>), and
  gives rise to deeply-placed mucous cells (<i>m.c</i>), which are glandular and pour out on the
  surface of the body a fluid in which the cilia vibrate. The tenacious hold on a stone which
  <i>Leptoplana</i> exerts if suddenly disturbed, or when grasping its prey, is probably due to the
  increased glutinous secretion of these glands, aided perhaps by rhabdites, which on such occasions
  are shot out in great numbers. The basement membrane is an elastic skeletal membrane composed of
  stellate cells embedded in a firm matrix. It serves chiefly for the origin and insertion of the
  dorso-ventral muscles (<i>d.v.m</i>). Under the basement membrane lies a very thin layer of
  transverse muscular fibres (Fig. 4, <i>rm</i>), which are, however, apparently absent on the
  ventral surface. Then follows a stout layer of longitudinal fibres (<i>l.m ext</i>), and beneath
  this a diagonal layer (<i>d.m</i>), the fibres of which intersect along the median line in such a
  way that the inner fibres of one side become the outer diagonal fibres of the other. Lastly,
  within this again, on the ventral surface, is a second stout longitudinal layer (<i>l.m int</i>).
  The sucker (<i>sc</i>, Figs. 2 and 5) is a modification of the body-wall at that point. In
  addition to the dorso-ventral muscles, there exists a complex visceral musculature regulating the
  movements of the pharynx, intestine, and copulatory organs.</p>

  <p><b>Parenchyma.</b>&mdash;The spaces between the main organs of the body are filled by a tissue
  containing various kinds of cells, salivary glands, shell-glands, and prostate glands. Besides
  these, however, we find a vacuolated, nucleated, thick-walled network, and to this the word
  parenchyma is properly applied. Besides its connective function, the parenchyma confers that
  elasticity on the body which <i>Leptoplana</i> possesses in such a high degree. Pigment cells are
  found in the parenchyma in many Polyclads.</p>

  <p><b>Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The general arrangement of this system may be seen in Figs. 2,
  5, and 7; and may be compared, especially when the pharynx is protruded, as in Fig. 2, with the
  gastral system of a Medusa. The "mouth" (there is no anus) is placed almost in the centre of the
  ventral surface. It leads (Fig. 7, B, <i>phs</i>) into a chamber (the peripharyngeal space)
  divided into an upper and a lower division by the insertion of a muscular collar-fold (the
  pharynx, <i>ph</i>), which may be protruded, its free lips <span class="pagenum" id="page13"><span
  class="smaller">{13}</span></span>advancing, through the mouth (Fig. 2), and is then capable of
  enclosing by its mobile frilled margin, prey as large as <i>Leptoplana</i> itself. The upper
  division of the chamber communicates by a hole in its roof<a id="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> (the true mouth, Figs. 5 and 7, <i>g.m</i>) with the cavity of
  the main-gut or stomach (<i>m.g</i>), which runs almost the length of the body in the middle line,
  forwards over the brain (Fig. 5, <i>up</i>). Seven pairs of lateral gut-branches convey the
  digested food to the various organs, not directly however, but only after the food mixed with
  sea-water has been repeatedly driven by peristalsis first towards the blind end of the
  gut-branches and then back towards the stomach. Respiration is probably largely effected by this
  means. The epithelium of the intestine (Fig. 4, <i>l.g</i>) of a starving specimen is composed of
  separate flagellated cells frequently containing "yellow cells."<a id="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> After a meal, however, the cell outlines are invisible.
  Gregarines, encysted Cercariae, and Orthonectida<a id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
  occur parasitically in the gut-branches.</p>

  <p>An <b>excretory system</b> of "flame-cells" and fine vessels has hitherto been seen only by
  Schultze<a id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> in this species, which will not, however,
  resist intact the compression necessary to enable the details to be determined. They are probably
  similar to those of <i>Thysanozoon</i> described on p. <a href="#page25">25</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The brain, which is enclosed in a tough capsule (Fig. 5,
  <i>br</i>), is placed in front of the pharynx, but some distance behind the anterior margin of the
  body. It is of an oval shape, subdivided superficially into right and left halves by a shallow
  depression, and is provided in front with a pair of granular-looking appendages, composed of
  ganglion-cells from which numerous sensory nerves arise, supplying the eyes and anterior region.
  Posteriorly the brain gives rise to a chiefly motor, nervous sheath (Fig. 5, <i>nn</i>), which
  invests the body just within the musculature. This sheath is thickened along two ventral lines
  (Fig. 5, <i>ln</i>) and two lateral lines (<i>n.s</i>), but is very slightly developed on the
  dorsal surface. Ganglion-cells occur on the course of the nerves, and are particularly large at
  the point of origin of the great motor nerves.</p>

  <p><b>Sense Organs.</b>&mdash;<i>Leptoplana</i> possesses eyes, stiff tactile, marginal cilia, and
  possibly a sense organ in the "marginal groove." The eyes, which are easily seen as collections of
  black dots lying at the sides of the brain, may be divided into two paired groups: (1) cerebral
  eyes (Fig. 5, <i>e</i>), and (2) tentacle eyes (<i>et</i>), which indicate the position of a pair
  of tentacles in allied forms (Fig. 8, A, <i>t</i> and B). Each ocellus consists of a capsule
  placed at right angles to the surface of the body in the parenchyma, below the dorsal muscles, and
  with its convex face outwards. It is a single cell in which pigment granules have accumulated. The
  light, however, can only reach the refractive rods, which lie within it, obliquely at their outer
  ends. These rods are in connexion with the retinal cells, and thus communicate by the optic nerve
  with the brain. The cerebral eyes are really paired, and are directed some upwards, some sideways,
  some downwards.</p>

  <p>The "marginal groove" is a shallow depression of the epidermis (Fig. 5, <i>gr</i>) lined by
  cilia, and containing the ducts of very numerous gland-cells. It runs almost parallel to the
  anterior margin of the body, a short distance from it, but we have no observations on its
  functions.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;<i>Leptoplana</i> is hermaphrodite, and, as in
  most hermaphrodites, the reproductive organs are complicated. The male organs are the first to
  ripen, but this does not appear to prevent an overlapping of the periods of maturity of the male
  and female products, so that when the eggs are being laid, the male organs are, apparently, still
  in a functional state. The principal parts are seen in Fig. 5. The very numerous <i>testes</i>
  (<i>te</i>) are placed ventrally, and are connected with fine vasa <i>efferentia</i> (<i>ve</i>),
  which form a delicate network opening at various points into the two <i>vasa deferentia</i>
  (<i>vd</i>). These tubes, especially when distended with spermatozoa, may easily be seen (Fig. 2,
  <i>vd</i>) converging at the base of the penis, and connected posteriorly by a loop that runs
  behind the female genital pore (Fig. 5). The <i>penis</i> (<i>pe</i>) is pyriform and muscular,
  and is divided into two chambers, a large upper one for the spermatozoa, and a smaller lower one
  for the secretion of a special <span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span
  class="smaller">{16}</span></span>"prostate" gland. The apex of the penis is eversible and not
  merely protrusible, being turned inside out when evaginated. The <i>ovaries</i> (Fig. 5,
  <i>ov</i>) are numerous and somewhat spherical. They are dorsally placed, but when fully developed
  extend deeply wherever they can find room to do so, and they not only furnish the ova, but
  elaborate food-yolk in the ova, as there are no special yolk-glands. The slender <i>oviducts</i>
  (<i>od</i>) open at several points into the "uterus" (<i>ut</i>) (a misnomer, as no development
  takes place within it), which encircles the pharynx, and opens by a single duct into the
  <i>vagina</i> (<i>va</i>). Here the ova are probably fertilised, and one by one invested by the
  <i>shell-gland</i> (<i>sg</i>) with a secretion which hardens and forms a resistant shell. They
  are then laid in plate-like masses which are attached to stones or shells. The development is a
  direct one, and the young <i>Leptoplana</i>, which hatches in about three weeks, has the outline
  of a spherical triangle, and possesses most of the organs of the adult. After leading a floating
  life for a few weeks it probably attains maturity in about nine months.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Classification, Habits, and Structure of the Polycladida.</b></p>

  <p>The Polyclads were so called by Lang on account of the numerous primary branches of their
  intestine. They are free-living, purely marine Platyhelminthes, possessing multiple ovaries,
  distinct male and female genital pores (Digonopora), but no yolk-glands. The eggs are small, and
  in many cases give rise to a distinct larval form, known as "M&uuml;ller's larva" (Fig. 12). The
  Polyclads, with one exception,<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> fall into two
  sub-groups, Acotylea and Cotylea<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Fig. 8 shows that, starting with a member (A, D) of each division, in which the mouth is almost
  in the middle of the ventral surface, and the brain and sense organs somewhat remote from the
  anterior end, we find in the Acotylea a series leading to an elongated form (Cestoplanidae), in
  which the mouth, pharynx, and genital pores are far back near the hinder end of the body; while in
  the Cotylea the series leads similarly to the elongated Prosthiostomatidae, in which, however, the
  pharynx and external apertures are in the front part of the body. This view of the morphology of
  the Polyclads is due to Lang, and is based on the assumption that the more radially-constructed
  forms (Fig. 8, A, D) are the primitive ones.</p>

  <p><b>Appearance and Size of Polyclad Turbellaria.</b>&mdash;Polyclads are almost unique amongst
  animals in possessing a broad and thin, delicate body that glides like a living pellicle over
  stones and weeds, moulding itself on to any inequalities of the surface over which it is
  travelling, yet so fragile that a touch of the finger will rend its tissues and often cause its
  speedy dissolution. The dorsal surface in a few forms is raised into fine processes (<i>Planocera
  villosa</i>), or into hollow papillae (<i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i>), and in very rare cases may be
  armed with spines (<i>Acanthozoon armatum</i>,<a id="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  <i>Enantia spinifera</i>); in others, again, nettle-cells (nematocysts) are found
  (<i>Stylochoplana tarda</i>, <i>Anonymus virilis</i>). Some Polyclads, especially the pelagic
  forms, are almost transparent; in others, the colour may be an intense orange or velvety black,
  and is then due to peculiar deposits in the epidermal cells. Between these two extremes the colour
  is dependent upon the blending of two sources, the pigment of the body itself and the tint of the
  food. Thus a starved <i>Leptoplana</i> is almost or quite white, a specimen fed on vascular tissue
  reddish. Many forms are coloured in such a way as to make their detection exceedingly difficult,
  but this is probably not merely due, as Dalyell supposed, to the substratum furnishing them with
  food and thus colouring them sympathetically, but is probably a result of natural selection.</p>

  <p>The largest Polyclad, the bulkiest Turbellarian, is <i>Leptoplana gigas</i> (6 inches long and
  4 in breadth), taken by Schmarda, free-swimming, off the coast of Ceylon. The largest European
  form is <i>Pseudoceros maximus</i>, 3&frac12; inches in length and stoutly built. A British species,
  <i>Prostheceraeus vittatus</i>, attains a length of from 2 to 3 inches. These large forms,
  especially the Pseudoceridae (pre-eminently the family of big Polyclads), are brightly coloured,
  and usually possess good swimming powers, since, being broad and flat, they are certainly not well
  adapted for creeping rapidly, and this is well shown by the way these Polyclads take to swimming
  when in pursuit of prey at night. The size of any individual is determined, amongst other factors,
  by the period at which maturity sets in, after which probably no increase takes place. Polyclads
  apparently live about twelve months, and mature specimens of the same species vary from &frac12; inch to
  2&frac12; inches in length (<i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i>), <span class="pagenum" id="page21"><span
  class="smaller">{21}</span></span>showing that growth is, under favourable conditions, very
  rapid.</p>

  <p><b>Habits of Polyclad Turbellaria.</b>&mdash;Polyclads are exclusively marine, and for the most
  part littoral, animals. Moreover, there is no evidence of their occurrence in those inland seas
  where certain marine animals (including one or two species of otherwise characteristically marine
  Rhabdocoelida, p. <a href="#page46">46</a>) have persisted under changed conditions. From
  half-tide mark down to 50 fathoms, some Polyclads probably occur on all coasts, but as to their
  relative abundance in different seas we have very little accurate information. The southern seas
  of Europe possess more individuals and species than the northern, and probably the maximum
  development of the group takes place on the coasts and coral islands of the tropics.<a id="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> No Polyclads have been taken below 60 fathoms; but their
  delicacy and inconspicuousness render this negative evidence of little value. Six truly pelagic
  forms, however, are known,<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> and these are
  interesting on account of their wide distribution (three occurring in the Atlantic, Pacific, and
  Indian oceans), and also from the distinct modifications they have undergone in relation to their
  pelagic existence.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the interpretations of the fact, Polyclads are notoriously difficult to detect,
  and this fact doubtless explains the scanty references to them by the older naturalists who
  collected even in tropical seas. Lang, who worked seven years at Naples, added to the
  Mediterranean fauna as many Polyclads as were previously known for all Europe, in spite of the
  assiduous labours of his predecessors, Delle Chiaje and Quatrefages. Again Hallez, collecting at
  Wimereux at low-water, obtained some twenty specimens of <i>Leptoplana tremellaris</i> in an hour,
  while some other collectors working by his side could only find two or three. Yet, even making
  allowance for the difficulty of finding Polyclads, few of them appear to be abundant.</p>

  <p><i>Leptoplana tremellaris</i> is frequently associated with colonies of <i>Botryllus</i>, and
  if separated soon perishes, whereas the free-living individuals are distinctly hardy (Hallez). A
  closely allied but possibly distinct form lives upon the surface of the Polyzoon <span
  class="pagenum" id="page22"><span class="smaller">{22}</span></span><i>Schizoporella</i>, on the
  French side of the Channel, and cannot long endure separation from its natural habitat, to which
  it is adaptively coloured. A striking case of protective mimicry is exhibited by <i>Cycloporus
  papillosus</i>, on the British coasts. This species, eminently variable in colour and in the
  presence or absence of dorsal papillae, is usually a quarter of an inch in length and of a firm
  consistency. Fixed by its sucker to Polyclinid and other Ascidians, <i>Cycloporus</i> appears part
  and parcel of the substratum, an interesting parallel to <i>Lamellaria perspicua</i>,<a
  id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> though we are not justified in calling the Polyclad
  parasitic. Indeed, though a few cases of association between Polyclads and large Gasteropods,
  Holothurians, and Echinids are known,<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> there is
  only one case, that of <i>Planocera inquilina</i>,<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
  in the branchial chamber of the Gasteropod <i>Sycotypus canaliculatus</i>, which would seem to
  bear the interpretation of parasitism. The jet-black <i>Pseudoceros velutinus</i> and the orange
  <i>Yungia aurantiaca</i> of the Mediterranean, are large conspicuous forms with no attempt at
  concealment, but their taste, which is not known, may protect them. Other habits, curiously
  analogous with devices employed by Nudibranch Mollusca (compare <i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i> with
  <i>Aeolis papillosa</i>), emphasise the conclusion that the struggle for existence in the littoral
  zone has adapted almost each Polyclad to its particular habitat.</p>

  <p>As regards the vertical distribution of this group on the British coasts, <i>Leptoplana
  tremellaris</i> has an extensive range, and appears to come from deeper to shallower water to
  breed.<a id="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> In the upper part of the Laminarian zone,
  <i>Cycloporus papillosus</i>, and, among brown weeds, <i>Stylochoplana maculata</i> are found. At
  and below lowest water-mark <i>Prostheceraeus vittatus</i>, <i>P. argus</i>, and <i>Eurylepta
  cornuta</i> occur. <i>Stylostomum variabile</i> and <i>Oligocladus sanguinolentus</i>, though
  occasionally found between tide-marks, especially in the Channel Islands, are characteristic,
  along with <i>Leptoplana droebachensis</i> and <i>L. fallax</i>, of dredge material from 10 to 20
  fathoms.</p>

  <p><b>Locomotion.</b>&mdash;Locomotion is generally performed by Polyclads at night when in search
  of food, and two methods, creeping <span class="pagenum" id="page23"><span
  class="smaller">{23}</span></span>and swimming, are usually employed&mdash;creeping by the cilia,
  aided possibly, as in the case of some Gasteropod Mollusca, by the longitudinal muscles of the
  ventral surface; and swimming, by undulations of the expanded margins of the body. In the former
  case the cilia work in a glandular secretion which bathes the body, and enables them to effect
  their purpose equally well on different substrata. The anterior region is generally lifted up,
  exploring the surroundings by the aid of the tentacles, which are here usually present. The rest
  of the body is closely appressed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Swimming is particularly well performed by the Pseudoceridae, certain species of
  <i>Prostheceraeus</i>, the large Planoceridae, some <i>Stylochoplana</i>, <i>Discocelis</i>, and
  <i>Leptoplana</i>, and in the same manner as in <i>Leptoplana tremellaris</i> (p. <a
  href="#page9">9</a>). In <i>Cryptocelis</i>, <i>Leptoplana alcinoi</i>, and <i>L. pallida</i>,
  however, the whole body executes serpentine movements like an active leech (e.g. <i>Nephelis</i>);
  a cross section of the body would thus present the same appearance during the whole movement. Many
  Polyclads, notably <i>Anonymus</i> (Lang), if irritated, spread out in all directions, becoming
  exceeding thin and transparent.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      (after Mertens), creeping on the inner side of a glass vessel by means of the lobes of the

  <p><i>Discocelis lichenoides</i>, <i>Planocera graffii</i>, and <i>Anonymus virilis</i> have
  peculiar modes of progression. The first, according to Mertens, will climb up the sides of a
  vessel by means of the expanded lobes of the pharynx (Fig. 9, <i>ph</i>), a habit of considerable
  interest, since we know that certain Ctenophores&mdash;<i>Lampetia</i>, for
  instance&mdash;progress when not swimming on the expanded lobes of their "stomach."<a id="NtA_33"
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> <i>Planocera</i> and <i>Anonymus</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page24"><span class="smaller">{24}</span></span>creep by extending parts of the anterior
  margin and dragging the rest of the body behind. In consequence, the brain and dorsal tentacles
  may come to lie actually behind the middle of the body, and thus no definite anterior end or
  "head" advances first. Along with this curious habit it may be noticed (Lang) that the radial
  symmetry of the body is well marked; but even without accepting this author's suggestion of the
  concurrent development of a "head" with locomotion in a definite direction, the facts, whether
  these two forms are primitive or not, are highly interesting.</p>

  <p><b>Food.</b>&mdash;Though we are probably right in calling Polyclads a carnivorous group, the
  food of very few forms has been ascertained. Those which possess a large frilled pharynx (most
  Acotylea) probably enclose and digest large, and, it may be, powerful prey, as appears to be the
  case in <i>Leptoplana tremellaris</i>. <i>Cryptocelis alba</i> has been seen by Lang with the
  pharynx so distended, owing to a large <i>Drepanophorus</i> (Nemertine) which it contained, as to
  resemble a yolk-sac projecting from the under surface of an embryo. The Cotylea such as
  <i>Thysanozoon</i>, with a bell- or trumpet-shaped pharynx, are fond of fixing this to the side of
  the aquarium, but whether they thus obtain minute organisms is not clear. <i>Prosthiostomum</i>
  shoots out its long pharynx with great vehemence (Fig. 8, F) and snaps up small Annelids by its
  aid (Lang). Those Polyclads which, as <i>Cycloporus</i> and others, are definitely associated with
  other organisms are not certainly known to feed upon the latter, though "<i>Planaria velellae</i>"
  has been seen by Lesson<a id="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> devouring the fleshy parts
  of its host. The salivary glands which open on the lips and the inner surface of the pharynx
  powerfully disintegrate the flesh of the prey. Digestion takes place in the main-gut, and the
  circulation of the food is accomplished by the sphinctral musculature of the intestinal branches
  (conf. <i>Leptoplana</i>, p. 13).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A distinct vent or anus is always absent. After a meal the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page25"><span class="smaller">{25}</span></span>faecal matter collects in the main-gut, and is
  discharged violently by the pharynx into the water. In a few species, however, the intestinal
  branches open to the exterior (Lang). <i>Yungia aurantiaca</i>, a large and abundant Neapolitan
  form, possesses such openings over the greater part of the dorsal surface; <i>Cycloporus
  papillosus</i> has marginal pores; <i>Oligocladus sanguinolentus</i> apparently possesses an
  opening at the posterior end of the main-gut; and <i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i> frequently rends at
  this point, in consequence of the accumulation of food.</p>

  <p><b>Respiration.</b>&mdash;The oxygen of the atmosphere dissolved in the sea-water is, in
  default of a special circulatory fluid, brought to the tissues of Polyclads in two ways. The
  ciliated epidermis provides a constant change of the surrounding water, by which the superficial
  organs may obtain their supply; and the peristaltic movements of the digestive system, aided by
  the cilia of the endoderm cells, ensure a rough circulation of the sea-water, which enters along
  with the food, to the internal organs. The papillae of <i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i>, containing
  outgrowths of the intestinal branches, are possibly so much additional respiratory surface,
  although still larger forms (other Pseudoceridae) are devoid of such outgrowths.</p>

  <p><b>Excretion.</b>&mdash;The excretory system of only one Polyclad (<i>Thysanozoon brocchii</i>)
  is accurately known. Lang, by compressing light-coloured specimens, found the three parts of the
  system known to occur in many Platyhelminthes: (1) the larger longitudinal canals, and (2) the
  capillary vessels, which commence with (3) the flame-cells in the parenchyma of the body. The mode
  of distribution of these parts is not, however, ascertained. The canals are delicate, sinuous,
  apparently intracellular tubes, coursing close to the margin of the body and sending offsets which
  suspend the canals to the dorsal surface, where possibly openings may occur. In dilatations of
  these vessels bunches of cilia, and occasionally flame-cells, are found. Usually, however,
  flame-cells occur at the commencement or during the course of the capillaries, which are straight,
  rarely branching, tubes of exceeding tenuity, and appear (Lang) to be outgrowths of the
  flame-cells, just as the duct is an outgrowth of a gland-cell. In fact there is little doubt that
  the stellate flame-cells are modified parenchymatous gland-cells, containing a lumen filled with a
  fluid into which a number of cilia project and vibrate synchronously. The cells excrete <span
  class="pagenum" id="page26"><span class="smaller">{26}</span></span>nitrogeneous waste substances,
  which are then discharged into the capillaries, whence the cilia of the main vessels drive them
  presumably to the exterior, though external openings of the excretory system are not known. Traces
  of this system have been observed in young <i>Leptoplana</i> (first by Schultze in 1854) and also
  in <i>Cestoplana</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sensation.</b>&mdash;A nervous sheath, with scattered ganglion cells, everywhere underlies
  the musculature. It is exceedingly faintly marked on the dorsal surface, but laterally and
  ventrally forms a dense network with polygonal meshes. Thickenings of this sheath give rise to
  lateral nerves, and also to a pair of stout longitudinal nerves from which the internal organs are
  probably innervated. The brain, hardly distinct in pelagic Polyclads, in most forms does not
  differ greatly from that of <i>Leptoplana</i> (p. <a href="#page13">13</a>).</p>

  <p>The sense organs of Polyclads have the form of tentacles, eyes, otocysts (in <i>Leptoplana
  otophora</i>), and stiff tactile cilia. The solid dorsal tentacles of Planoceridae contrast
  strongly with the folded or pointed hollow processes of the Cotylea. The former (Fig. 8, A,
  <i>T</i>) are muscular and very contractile, and are placed near the brain some distance from the
  anterior end. The latter are outgrowths of the front margin of the body, and are sometimes
  (<i>Yungia</i>) provided superficially with olfactory pits and internally with eyes and intestinal
  coeca.</p>

  <p>The eyes which occur in Polyclads may be divided into (<i>a</i>) a pair of cerebral groups
  overlying the brain; (<i>b</i>) those embedded in the tentacles (tentacular group); and (<i>c</i>)
  the marginal eyes, which in <i>Anonymus</i> occur all round the margin. A complex form is
  sometimes assumed by the cerebral eyes of Pseudoceridae, resulting probably from incomplete
  fission (Fig. 11). <i>Leptoplana otophora</i> was obtained by Schmarda on the south coast of
  Ceylon. On each side of the brain is a capsule containing two otoliths. This is the only known
  case of the occurrence of these organs in Polyclads.</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;Although Polyclads are able to repair the result of injuries to a
  very considerable extent, they are not known to multiply asexually. The two processes are
  intimately associated, but, though probably all Turbellaria can regenerate certain lost parts,
  asexual reproduction only occurs sporadically.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All known Polyclads are hermaphrodite. The male organs, scattered, like the testes of
  <i>Leptoplana</i>, over the ventral surface, develop earlier than the ovaries, though the periods
  of maturation overlap; hence the possibility of self-fertilisation, though remote, is still worth
  consideration. The genital apertures, through which, in the male, spermatozoa, and in the female,
  ova, are emitted, are usually situated as in <i>Leptoplana</i> (Figs. 2 and 5, &#x2642; and
  &#x2640;). In <i>Trigonoporus</i>, a genus once found at Naples, a secondary female aperture has
  been discovered leading into the female genital canal<a id="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>; and in <i>Anonymus</i>, <i>Polypostia</i>, and
  <i>Thysanozoon</i> (Fig. 7, E, &#x2642;) two or more male pores and penes have been found.
  <i>Anonymus</i> has several penes (Fig. 7, D, &#x2642;) arranged radially round the body.
  <i>Polypostia</i>, a remarkable form described by Bergendal,<a id="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> belonging to the Acotylea, possesses about twenty such
  structures ranged round the female genital aperture. Lang, whose attention was attracted by these
  singular facts, made the interesting discovery that <i>Thysanozoon</i> uses its penes as weapons
  of offence rather than as copulating organs, burying them in the skin of another Polyclad
  (<i>Yungia</i>) that happened to cross its path, spermatozoa being of course left in the wound.
  Lang further found that <i>Prostheceraeus albocinctus</i> and <i>Cryptocelis alba</i> in this way
  implanted a spermatophore in the skin of another individual of the same species, and he suggested
  that from this point the spermatozoa wandered through the tissues till they met with and
  fertilised the eggs. It is now known that a similar process of "hypodermic impregnation" occurs
  sporadically in several groups of animals.<a id="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page28"><span class="smaller">{28}</span></span>Nevertheless, in some
  Polyclads it is probable, and in <i>Stylochus neapolitanus</i> it is certain, that normal
  copulation takes place. The sperm-masses are transferred to a coecal diverticulum of the female
  genital canal, and then by a delicate mechanism, of which we know only the effects, one
  spermatozoon obtains entrance into one matured ovum, which differs from the ova of most
  Turbellaria in that it contains in its own protoplasm the yolk necessary for the nutrition of the
  embryo. In other words, there are no special yolk-glands. After fertilisation, the ovum in all
  Polyclads is coated with a shell formed by the shell-gland, which also secretes a substance
  uniting the eggs together. They are deposited on stones and shells, either in plate-like masses or
  in spirals (like those of Nudibranchs). <i>Cryptocelis alba</i> lays masses of an annular shape,
  with two ova in each shell, and buries them in sand.</p>

  <p><b>Development.</b><a id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>&mdash;The first stages in
  the embryology of Polyclads appear to be very uniform. They result, in all Cotylea and in certain
  Planoceridae, in the formation of a M&uuml;ller's larva (Fig. 12) about a couple of weeks after the
  eggs are laid. This larva (1-1.8 mm. long), which is modified in the Planoceridae, is
  distinguished by the presence of a ciliated band, running somewhat transversely round the body,
  and usually produced into a dorsal, a ventral, and three pairs of lateral processes. When swimming
  the body is placed as in Fig. 12, and twists round rapidly about its longitudinal axis by means of
  the strong locomotor cilia placed in transverse rows upon the processes. The cilia of each row
  vibrate synchronously, and recall the action of the swimming plates of a Ctenophore. It is
  noteworthy that whereas <i>Stylochus pilidium</i> passes through a modified or, according to some
  authors, a primitive larval stage, its near ally, <i>S. neapolitanus</i>, develops directly. Most
  <span class="pagenum" id="page29"><span class="smaller">{29}</span></span>Acotylea indeed develop
  directly, and their free-swimming young differ from M&uuml;ller's larva merely in the absence of the
  ciliated band and in the mode of swimming.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Polyclads possess an undoubted mesoderm, which gives rise to the muscles, the
  pharyngeal fold, and the parenchyma. The ectoderm forms the epidermis, in the cells of which the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page30"><span class="smaller">{30}</span></span>rhabdites (Fig. 12)
  arise, apparently as so many condensed secretions. From the ectoderm the brain arises as two pairs
  of ingrowths, which fuse together, and from these the peripheral nervous system grows out. Three
  pigmented ectoderm cells give rise, by division, to the eyes&mdash;an unpaired cell (Fig. 12,
  <i>e</i>) to the cerebral group of eyes, and the other two to the marginal and tentacular groups.
  The copulatory organs apparently arise to a large extent as ingrowths from the ectoderm, from
  which the accessory glands (prostates, shell-glands) are also formed. The endoderm forms the
  lining of the main-gut and its branches. The pharynx is developed as in Fig. 13, which shows that
  the "mouth" of the young larva (C) does not correspond exactly with that of the adult (D). The
  salivary glands arise from ectoderm cells, which sink deeply into the parenchyma. The reproductive
  organs (ovaries and testes) possibly arise by proliferation from the gut-cells (Lang,
  v.&nbsp;Graff). The change from the larva to the adult is gradual, the ciliary band being absorbed
  and the creeping mode of life adopted.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Turbellaria. II. Tricladida.</b></p>

  <p>The Triclads are most conveniently divided into three groups<a id="NtA_39"
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>: (i.) <i>Paludicola</i>, the Planarians of ponds and streams;
  (ii.) the <i>Maricola</i>, the Triclads of the sea; and (iii.) <i>Terricola</i> or Land
  Planarians. From the Polyclads they differ in their mode of occurrence; in the elongated form of
  their body and almost constant, mid-ventral position of the mouth; in possessing a single external
  genital pore (Monogopora); and in the production of a few, large, hard-shelled eggs provided with
  food-yolk.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence of the Paludicola.</b>&mdash;The Planarians of our ponds and streams are the most
  familiar and accessible Turbellaria. Their elongated, flattened bodies, and gliding movements,
  render them conspicuous objects on the under surface of stones and on the leaves of aquatic
  plants, where they live gregariously. The variable <i>Polycelis nigra</i> (Fig. 14, H) is very
  abundant in stagnant water and slowly-moving streams, whereas its ally, <i>P. cornuta</i> (Fig.
  14, G), distinguished by a pair of tentacles, is more local. <i>Planaria</i> (<i>Dendrocoelum</i>)
  <i>lactea</i> (A), <i>P. polychroa</i> (I), <i>P. torva</i>, and <i>P. punctata</i> are not
  infrequently found together, but the last is at once the largest and rarest.</p>

  to <span class="pagenum" id="page32"><span class="smaller">{32}</span></span>sea-level in England,
  the Isle of Man, and Ireland, and from its abundance in spring water, probably enjoys a wide
  distribution underground. In the Swiss Alps it has been found at altitudes of over 6000 feet, at
  lower levels in the Rhone, and also in the Lake of Geneva. This wide distribution may perhaps be
  accounted for, partly, by its faculty for asexual reproduction in summer, and also, by the
  production, later in the year, of hard-shelled eggs which are laid loosely, not attached to stones
  or plants.<a id="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> But we have no really direct evidence
  of the means of dispersal of this or of any of the foregoing species, although they all have a
  wide distribution in Europe. Of extra-European forms the accounts that exist are very fragmentary.
  The only indubitable diagnostic character of a Triclad is the structure of its genital ducts, and
  this is accurately known in only a few cases. Several species such as <i>Dicotylus pulvinar</i>
  (Fig. 16, B), at present known only from Lake Baikal,<a id="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and others (<i>Planaria mrazekii</i>, <i>P. albissima</i>) from
  Bohemia,<a id="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> will doubtless be found elsewhere when
  they are carefully looked for. <i>Phagocata gracilis</i> is a remarkable North American form,
  possessing several pharynges (Fig. 14, C and C'), recalling the independent movement of the
  pharyngeal lobes of <i>Discocelis lichenoides</i> (Fig. 9).<a id="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Occurrence of the Maricola.</b>&mdash;Little as we accurately know of the distribution of
  the fresh-water Planariae, our knowledge of the occurrence of the marine forms is still more
  limited. <i>Gunda</i> (<i>Procerodes</i>) <i>ulvae</i> (Fig. 14, D) is the commonest European
  form, occurring abundantly in the upper part of the littoral zone, on the shores of the Baltic.
  <i>G. segmentata</i> from Messina has been carefully described by Lang,<a id="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> but these are almost the only species of Maricola which can be
  accurately determined. They differ from the Paludicola in the position of the "uterus" behind the
  genital pore and in the absence of a "musculo-glandular organ" (Fig. 14, F). A special interest
  attaches to the Bdellouridae, a family containing three species, all parasitic on <i>Limulus</i>
  from the east coast of America. These remarkable Triclads usually have a sucker at the hinder end
  of the body, by which they attach themselves firmly to the cephalo-thoracic appendages and to the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page33"><span class="smaller">{33}</span></span>gill-plates, upon which
  the eggs may be found in considerable numbers. One species, <i>Syncoelidium pellucidum</i>,
  possesses a pair of problematical organs in the hinder part of the body, opening to the exterior
  ventro-laterally by a couple of chitinous mouth-pieces, but having no connexion with the genital
  ducts.<a id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Occurrence and Distribution of Land Planarians.</b>&mdash;The terricolous Triclads or Land
  Planarians are the most interesting division of the group. Some forms, such as <i>Bipalium
  kewense</i>, attain large dimensions, being usually 6 to 9 inches in length, and specimens fully
  extended have measured 18 inches. Their bodies are frequently banded or striped with brilliant
  colours. <i>Geoplana coerulea</i> Mos. has a blue ventral surface and is olive green or dark
  Prussian blue above. <i>G. splendens</i> Dendy, is marked dorsally by three stripes of emerald
  green alternating with four dark brown longitudinal bands. The mode of coloration, though somewhat
  variable, is an important specific character. Its significance, however, is not clearly
  understood. The colours may be a warning signal, as some <i>Geoplana</i> at least are disagreeable
  to the taste of man and some birds<a id="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>; but since Land
  Planarians are largely nocturnal animals, living by day under logs, banana leaves, and in other
  moist and dark situations, this explanation is clearly insufficient. Two <i>Geoplana</i> have been
  noticed by Mr. Dendy which seem to be protectively coloured. <i>G. triangulata</i> var.
  <i>australis</i> occurs abundantly in the beech forest in the South Island of New Zealand, and its
  brown back and yellow or orange ventral surface match the leaves around its haunts. <i>G.
  gelatinosa</i> again looks like a mere slimy patch on the rotten bark where it is found. In arid
  districts, during the dry season, Land Planarians burrow in the soil and form a cyst, in which
  they lie coiled up, after the manner of earthworms.<a id="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> The glutinous investment of their delicate bodies forms a moist
  medium in which the cilia covering the body (and especially the ventral surface) may constantly
  and evenly vibrate, and by which they adhere firmly to their prey. In some tropical Planarians, in
  addition to possessing offensive properties, the mucus is so copious in amount and hardens with
  such rapidity, that <span class="pagenum" id="page34"><span
  class="smaller">{34}</span></span>these Triclads may creep over bridges of it, and may even be
  blown from one stem or branch of a plant to another, hanging at the ends of their threads.<a

  </div>

  <p>In Europe there are only two or three indigenous Land Planarians, of which <i>Rhynchodemus
  terrestris</i> O. F. M. (Fig. 15, B) is the most widely distributed, and has been found in moist
  situations for the most part wherever it has been carefully looked for. It measures about &frac34; inch
  in length, and is dark grey above, whitish below, and bears a pair of eyes near the anterior
  extremity (Fig. 15, B). <i>Bipalium kewense</i> (Fig. 15, A), which has been found in the forests
  of Upolu, Samoa, by Mr. J. J. Lister, has been accidentally imported, from the (unknown) districts
  where it is indigenous, with plants and soil to various parts of the world&mdash;England, Germany,
  the Cape, and also to Sydney, where it appears to have established itself. In these Bipalia living
  in hothouses, the genitalia never appear to attain maturity, and apparently multiple fission and
  subsequent reparation of the missing parts is the only mode of reproduction. <i>Geodesmus
  bilineatus</i> (Fig. 15, C), which has occurred at Giessen, W&uuml;rzburg, and Dresden, has, in all
  probability, been introduced with ferns from the West or East Indies. <i>Microplana humicola</i>,
  described by Vejdovsky from dunghills in Bohemia, is doubtfully indigenous.</p>

  <p>In marked contrast with the poverty of the temperate zones in Land Planarians, is the abundance
  and great variety of this group in Southern Asia, South America, and especially in Australasia,
  where the rich Land Planarian fauna has been carefully investigated by Spencer, Dendy, Fletcher,
  and others, in <span class="pagenum" id="page35"><span class="smaller">{35}</span></span>certain
  parts of Victoria, New South Wales, and New Zealand.<a id="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> About forty species of Planarians have been discovered on the
  Australian continent, thirty-five of which belong to the predominant genus <i>Geoplana</i>,
  distinguished by the presence of numerous eyes along the border of the simple anterior extremity.
  Of the remaining five, four belong to the genus <i>Rhynchodemus</i>, with, lastly, the introduced
  <i>Bipalium kewense</i>. The distribution of any one species, however, is so limited that only
  three forms are common to the two former colonies; and although some of the twenty known New
  Zealand Planarians (chiefly species of <i>Geoplana</i>), are identical with Australian species,
  yet only one, or possibly two, varieties of these species are Australian also. In addition to
  their prevalence in Australasia, the <i>Geoplanidae</i> also occur in South America, South Africa,
  Japan, and the East Indies. The <i>Bipaliidae</i> are characteristic of the Oriental region, being
  found in China, Borneo, Bengal, and Ceylon. The <i>Rhynchodemidae</i> are a cosmopolitan family,
  occurring in Europe, North and South America, the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, the East Indies,
  Australia (particularly Lord Howe Island), and Samoa.<a id="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Habits and Structure of Triclads.</b>&mdash;The common <i>Planaria</i> (<i>Dendrocoelum</i>)
  <i>lactea</i>, which usually progresses by ciliary action, aided, it is said, by muscular
  contractions of the ventral surface, performs, if alarmed, a series of rapid "looping" movements,
  by affixing a sucker (Fig. 14, A, <i>sc</i>), placed on the under side of the head, to the
  substratum, and pulling the posterior end close to this. The sucker, discovered by Leydig, is even
  better developed in <i>P. punctata</i> (Fig. 16, A), <i>P. mrazekii</i>, and <i>P. cavatica</i>,
  and is an efficient adhering-organ which has probably been developed from a similar but simpler
  structure found in a considerable number of both fresh-water and marine Triclads (<i>P.
  alpina</i>, Fig. 16, E). Probably the sucker of the Land Planarian <i>Cotyloplana</i> (D) is the
  same structure, but the two suckers of <i>Dicotylus</i> (B) are at present unique. <i>Planaria
  dioica</i>, found by Clapar&egrave;de on the coast of Normandy,<a id="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> is covered with minute adhesive papillae, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page36"><span class="smaller">{36}</span></span>similar to those of certain Rhabdocoelida
  (e.g. <i>Monotus</i>, Fig. 19, D), enabling it to cling tightly to the <i>Zostera</i>, and so to
  resist the loosening action of the waves.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The movements of Land Planarians are somewhat peculiar. The ventral surface of <i>Bipalium</i>
  has a median groove, into which the ducts of numerous mucus-glands open. This is bordered by two
  ridges clothed with long and powerful cilia, which perform the chief part in propelling the
  animal, aided, according to Lehnert,<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> by muscular
  waves which pass from the head, backwards, <i>i.e.</i> opposite in direction to those by which a
  snail slides along. This observation, however, needs confirmation. The whole body executes sinuous
  movements, during which the crescentic head, lifted slightly above the ground (Fig. 15, A), is
  constantly altering and regaining its normal shape, somewhat as a <i>Planaria lactea</i> uses the
  lobes of its head. Further examination shows that the margin of the head of <i>Bipalium</i> is not
  only provided with eyes, but in addition, with ciliated, (probably) olfactory pits. Such
  depressions, innervated directly from the cerebral ganglia, have been found in sixteen species of
  <i>Geoplana</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page37"><span class="smaller">{37}</span></span>and in
  one or two species of <i>Rhynchodemus</i>.<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Some
  Land Planarians (a species of <i>Rhynchodemus</i> from Ceylon, and a <i>Dolichoplana</i> from the
  Philippines) wriggle out of a box or the hand with great speed (Moseley).</p>

  <p>The skin of Triclads is full of minute rods or rhabdites, which are shot out in great numbers
  when the animal is irritated, and doubtless serve an offensive purpose. The Terricola possess two
  kinds of these: (1) needle-like rods; and (2) in <i>Bipalium kewense</i>, flagellated structures,
  bent into a V-form and with a slender thread attached to one end (Shipley). In <i>Geoplana
  coerulea</i> these bent rods furnish the blue colour of the ventral surface. The rhabdites arise
  in all Triclads in cells below the basement-membrane, which they are said to traverse in order to
  reach the epidermis, thus differing in origin, and also in structure, from the rods of
  Polyclads.</p>

  <p><b>Food.</b>&mdash;Triclads are largely if not wholly carnivorous animals, feeding upon
  Annelids, Crustacea, Insects, Insect-larvae, and Molluscs. The mouth is usually mid-ventral or
  behind the middle of the body, but in the anomalous <i>Leimacopsis terricola</i> Schm. from the
  Andes<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> and in <i>Dolichoplana</i> it is near the
  anterior end. The pharynx (Figs. 17, 18, <i>ph</i>) is cylindrical or bell-shaped, exceedingly
  dilatable and abundantly supplied with glands and nervous tissue. It opens into the three main
  intestinal branches, one of which runs in the median plane forwards, the others backwards right
  and left, enclosing a space in which the genital ducts lie (Figs. 14, A, 17). The fresh-water
  Planarians prey upon Oligochaeta, Hydrophilidae (aquatic beetles), and the commoner pond-snails.
  <i>Bipalium kewense</i> pursues earthworms, seizes the upper surface of the anterior end by the
  glutinous secretion of its ventral surface, and then proceeds to envelop part or the whole of the
  worm within its pharynx, which is stretched as a thin skin over the body of its struggling prey
  (Lehnert). The tissues of the latter pass into the intestine of the Planarian, and distend it
  greatly. After such a meal, which lasts from one to five hours, a <i>Bipalium</i> may remain for
  three months without seeking food. <i>Geobia subterranea</i>, a white eyeless form from Brazil,
  pursues earthworms (<i>Lumbricus corethrurus</i>) in their burrows, and has been seen by Fritz
  M&uuml;ller sucking the blood out of a young <span class="pagenum" id="page38"><span
  class="smaller">{38}</span></span>worm.<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
  <i>Geoplana typhlops</i>, a Tasmanian species, is also blind, and pursues worms, as does <i>G.
  triangulata</i> (Dendy). In Trinidad, von Kennel<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
  observed that land-snails (Subulinae) were the food of certain Land Planarians, the name of which,
  however, he does not state. The pharynx was employed to suck out the soft parts of the snail even
  from the upper whorls of the shell.</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;In <i>Planaria lactea</i> the numerous testes (Fig. 17, <i>te</i>)
  are placed both above and below the alimentary canal throughout the greater part of its course.
  The membrane of each gonad is continued into a minute vas efferens, which unites with those of
  neighbouring testes. Two vasa deferentia (<i>v.d</i>) arise thus on each side, one from the
  posterior, the other from the anterior testes of the body, and open into the vesiculae seminales
  (<i>v.s</i>), which may be seen in the living animal as tortuous whitish tubes at the sides of the
  pharynx (Fig. 14, A). These open into the penis (Figs. 14, A; 17, <i>pe</i>), a large pyriform
  organ, the apex of which, when retracted, points forwards, projecting into the penial cavity. When
  this apical portion is evaginated and turned inside out, it is of considerable length, and is able
  to pass into the long slender duct of the uterus (<i>ut</i>) of another individual. The penial
  sheath (<i>ps</i>) is part of the genital atrium (<i>gs</i>), which is developed as a pit from the
  skin, and invests the end of the genital ducts, the mouth of the pit forming the common genital
  pore (<i>go</i>), through which both male and female genital products are emitted.</p>

  <p>There are two ovaries (<i>ov</i>) placed far forwards, between the third and fourth pairs of
  intestinal coeca. The oviducts (<i>ovd</i>) lie just over the lateral nerves, and have a slightly
  tortuous course, at each outward bend receiving the duct (<i>yo</i>) of a yolk-gland (<i>yg</i>),
  so that ova and yolk are already associated when the oviducts open by a short unpaired tube into
  the genital atrium. The yolk-glands develop rapidly,<a id="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> and when fully formed are massive glands occupying the spaces
  between the intestinal branches and the testes which are then aborting. The so-called
  <i>uterus</i> (<i>ut</i>), apparently at first a diverticulum of the genital atrium, expands
  behind the pharynx into a receptacle lined by long glandular columnar cells, which, however, are
  not all of the same kind. The uterine duct opens into the atrium just above the aperture of a
  problematical, eversible, "musculo-glandular organ" (<i>mgr</i>).</p>

  <p>Fertilisation appears to occur in the uterus, where ova, yolk, and spermatozoa, or (in <i>P.
  torva</i>) spermatophores (Fig. 14, N, <i>sp</i>), are found. The formation of the cocoon in
  <i>Planaria lactea</i> is probably begun in the "uterus," but is undoubtedly completed in the
  genital atrium. In <i>P. polychroa</i>, however, the stalked cocoon is formed wholly in the
  "uterus." Thus we find two types of cocoons in different species of the genus <i>Planaria</i>
  associated with two types of reproductive organs (Hallez)<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>I. Planariae in which the two oviducts open separately into the posterior part of the duct of
  the uterus. A musculo-glandular organ is absent. The cocoons are spherical and stalked.
  Examples&mdash;<i>Planaria polychroa</i> (Fig. 14, L), <i>P. albissima</i>, <i>P.
  gonocephala</i>.</p>

  <p>II. Planariae in which the two oviducts open by means of an unpaired duct into the genital
  atrium.  A musculo-glandular organ present (<i>Planaria torva</i> (Fig. 14, N), <i>P.
  mrazekii</i>, <i>P. lactea</i>, <i>P. cavatica</i>), or absent (<i>P. alpina</i>, Fig. 14, M).
  The cocoons are sessile.</p>

  <p>The genitalia of the Maricola (Fig. 14, F) and Terricola do not differ very much from those of
  <i>Planaria</i>. The uterus (greatly reduced in the Land Planarians) lies behind the genital pore,
  and several ova, together with much milky yolk, are enclosed in a capsule which is formed in the
  genital atrium.</p>

  <p><b>Asexual Reproduction.</b><a id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>&mdash;It has long
  been known that fresh-water Planarians have not only great powers of repairing injuries, but that
  they use this faculty in order to multiply by transverse fission. <i>Planaria alpina</i> and
  <i>Polycelis cornuta</i>, in summer, separate off the posterior part of the body, and this
  ultimately becomes an entire individual. <i>P. albissima</i>, and especially <i>P.
  subtentaculata</i>, anticipate matters so far, that before fission is complete, the new individual
  has a head nearly fully formed. The new organs are largely regenerated in both parent and young,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span class="smaller">{41}</span></span>apparently by the
  division and specialisation of scattered embryonic cells in the parenchyma. The asexual
  reproduction of Land Planarians is not fully proved, though it is known that they repair injuries
  to the body completely, and that <i>Bipalium kewense</i> is often found in hothouses, divided into
  fragments which regenerate all the organs of the parent, but like the latter, do not mature their
  sexual organs.</p>

  the latest observer, Chickoff,<a id="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> was unable to see
  them, although to him we are indebted for figures of this system in <i>P. lactea</i> (Fig. 18) and
  <i>P. alpina</i> (<i>P. montana</i>). In the latter, the flame-cells are distinct, and may open
  directly into the two main canals or indirectly through unbranched canaliculi. The pharynx
  possesses a special supply of excretory tubules communicating with the main canals. A similar
  system has been described and figured in <i>Gunda segmentata</i> by Lang.<a id="NtA_60"

  <p class="ac"><b>Turbellaria. III. Rhabdocoelida.</b></p>

  <p>The Rhabdocoelida include a very heterogeneous assemblage of usually minute Turbellaria,
  distinguished collectively from the Polyclads and Triclads by the form of the digestive tract.
  This is a simple or slightly lobed sac, except in the Bothrioplanidae, which in this and many
  other points closely resemble the Triclads. It is to the straight, rod-like nature of the
  alimentary canal that the name of the group refers. The size and form of the body, and the
  structure of the pharynx and genitalia, vary within wide limits.</p>

  <p>The Rhabdocoelida are subdivided into three tribes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) <i>Acoela</i>, in which a sub-central mouth and pharynx are present, but lead into the
  parenchyma of the body, not into an intestine with proper walls. An excretory system has not
  hitherto been seen. Yolk-glands are absent. An otolith underlies the brain. The <i>Acoela</i> are
  marine.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span class="smaller">{43}</span></span></div>

  <p>(2) <i>Rhabdocoela</i>, which possess a complete alimentary tract separated from the body-wall
  (except for a few suspensory strands) by a space or body-cavity, filled with fluid. This space is
  sometimes (<i>Vortex viridis</i>) lined by an endothelium of flattened parenchymatous cells. There
  are two compact testes, which are enclosed (as are the ovaries and yolk-glands) in a distinct
  membrane. An otolith is present in some genera and species. Terrestrial, fresh-water, marine.</p>

  <p>(3) <i>Alloeocoela</i>, in which the body-cavity is greatly reduced. Except in the
  Bothrioplanidae, the gonads have no distinct membrane. Testes numerous; yolk-glands present.
  Marine with a few exceptions.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence and Habits of the Rhabdocoelida.</b>&mdash;The <i>Acoela</i> are usually minute,
  active Turbellaria abounding amongst weeds throughout the lower half of the Littoral, and the
  whole of the Laminarian zone, but are most plentiful in the pools exposed during spring-tides on
  our coasts, especially on the shores of Devonshire. The species of <i>Haplodiscus</i>, however,
  and <i>Convoluta henseni</i> are modified pelagic forms found in the Atlantic Ocean.<a id="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> <i>Convoluta paradoxa</i> (Fig. 19, B) is the commonest British
  species. It is from 1 to 9 mm. in length, and of a brown colour, marked above by one or more
  transverse white bars. The brown colour is due to a symbiotic alga, the nature of which has not
  been thoroughly investigated. In an allied species, however (<i>C. roscoffensis</i>), from the
  coast of Brittany, the alga, which is here green, has been carefully examined by Professor
  Haberlandt,<a id="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> and it appears from his researches
  that the algae form a special assimilating tissue, enabling the <i>Convoluta</i> to live after the
  fashion of a green plant. At Roscoff, these elongated green <i>Convoluta</i> live gregariously in
  the sandy tide-pools, fully exposed to the sun's rays, and have the appearance of a mass of weed
  floating at the surface of the water. Access to the atmosphere and to sunlight are necessary in
  order to enable the assimilating tissue to form the carbohydrates, upon which this form lives
  exclusively. Not only has the alga itself undergone such profound changes (loss of membrane,
  inability to live independently after the death of the host) as to disguise its true nature (a
  tissue-cell derived from algal ancestors), but the <i>Convoluta</i> has also undergone <span
  class="pagenum" id="page44"><span class="smaller">{44}</span></span>concomitant changes, in form,
  in the loss of a carnivorous habit, and in the development of marked heliotropic movements, thus
  adapting itself to an holophytic or plant-like mode of nutrition. Nevertheless the Acoela, as a
  group, are carnivorous, feeding upon Diatoms, Copepoda, and small Rhabdocoela, the absence of a
  digestive tract indeed being probably more apparent than real.<a id="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <i>Rhabdocoela</i> live under varied conditions. One form, <i>Prorhynchus
  sphyrocephalus</i>, has been found among plants far from water in the neighbourhood of Leyden, by
  De Man.<a id="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> With this exception the group is purely
  aquatic, and though a few genera and even individuals of the same species occur both in salt and
  fresh water, whole sub-families and genera are either marine or paludicolous. Among the latter,
  <i>Mesostoma</i>, <i>Castrada</i>, <i>Vortex</i>, and <i>Derostoma</i> are common in brooks and
  ponds, especially at certain times, often only for one month (May or June) in the year. Species of
  <i>Macrostoma</i>, <i>Stenostoma</i>, and <i>Microstoma</i> are also abundant in similar places.
  The two latter occur in chains formed by fission; but the sexual individuals (which are of
  distinct sexes, contrary to the usual hermaphrodite condition of Flat Worms) only appear at stated
  times and are not well known. A large number of genera are purely marine, and one family, the
  Proboscidae (distinguished by having the anterior end invaginated by special muscles and converted
  into a sensory organ), is entirely so. The most cursory examination of littoral weeds reveals
  species of <i>Macrorhynchus</i>, <i>Acrorhynchus</i>, <i>Promesostoma</i>, <i>Byrsophlebs</i>, and
  <i>Proxenetes</i>, the character of which may be gathered from von Graffs great monograph, or from
  Gamble's paper on the "British Marine Turbellaria."<a id="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Much, however, still remains to be done before we possess an
  adequate idea of the occurrence of this group on our coasts.</p>

  <p>Some Rhabdocoels are parasitic. <i>Fecampia erythrocephala</i>, which occurs in the lacunar
  spaces and alimentary canal of young shore crabs (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>), is a white cylindrical
  animal &frac14; inch long, with a red snout. After attaining maturity it works its way out of the crab
  and encysts under stones, forming a pyriform mass in shape like a "Prince Rupert's drop." Within
  this case the eggs develop, and the young probably emerge through the open narrow end of the hard
  white tube, but how they reach the crab is not known. <i>Graffilla muricicola</i> is found in the
  kidney of <i>Murex brandaris</i> and <i>M. trunculus</i>, at Naples and Trieste; <i>G.
  tethydicola</i> in the foot of <i>Tethys</i>. <i>Anoplodium parasiticum</i> occurs among the
  muscles which attach the cloaca of <i>Holothuria tubulosa</i> to the body-wall; and <i>A.
  schneideri</i> occurs in the sea-cucumber, <i>Stichopus variegatus</i>. These are truly parasitic
  forms, constituting a special sub-family. They have no rhabdites in the skin; the nervous system
  and sense-organs are only slightly developed; and the pharynx has undergone a notable reduction in
  relation to the simpler mode of obtaining nourishment. Other cases of association between certain
  Rhabdocoels (closely allied to, if not identical with, certain free-living species) and
  Lamellibranchs or Sea-urchins, are, however, of another kind. Thus on the gills or in the mantle
  cavity of species of <i>Mytilus</i>, <i>Cyprina</i>, <i>Tellina</i>, and upon the test of
  <i>Clypeaster</i>, such forms as <i>Enterostoma mytili</i>, <i>Acmostoma cyprinae</i>, and
  <i>Provortex tellinae</i> have been found. But it is probable that these Turbellaria here obtain
  merely a temporary <span class="pagenum" id="page46"><span
  class="smaller">{46}</span></span>shelter and possibly a supply of the food of the mussel or
  sea-urchin.</p>

  <p>The <i>Alloeocoela</i> afford a well-established case of association. <i>Monotus fuscus</i>
  (Fig. 19, D), an abundant, active, elongated animal, lives on our coasts in the upper part of the
  littoral zone among <i>Patella</i>, <i>Balanus</i>, and sometimes <i>Chiton</i>. When the tide is
  low, the <i>Monotus</i>, to obtain moisture and darkness, creeps between the mantle-folds of these
  animals, where it may readily be found. Upon the return of the tide it leaves its retreat and
  creeps or swims about freely. Other Alloeocoela collect in great numbers in tufts of red-seaweeds
  (Florideae). By placing such tufts in vessels, the sea-water, especially as darkness sets in,
  begins to swarm with <i>Cylindrostoma 4-oculatum</i>, species of <i>Enterostoma</i> and
  <i>Plagiostoma</i>; <i>P. vittatum</i>, with three violet bands across the white body, being a
  particularly obvious form. <i>Vorticeros auriculatum</i> (Fig. 19, C), another abundant species,
  is remarkable for the long tentacles which can be completely withdrawn, and in this condition it
  completely resembles a <i>Plagiostoma</i>.</p>

  <p>The presence of a species (<i>P. lemani</i>) of the characteristically marine genus
  <i>Plagiostoma</i>, in the Lake of Geneva, and in one or two other Swiss lakes, at depths varying
  from 1 to 150 fathoms, is very interesting, and is perhaps the only well-established case of the
  survival of a once marine Rhabdocoelid under changed conditions. <i>Plagiostoma lemani</i> is by
  far the biggest of the group to which it belongs, being over half an inch in length. It is usually
  found in fine mud, sometimes among <i>Chara hispida</i>, and has the general appearance of an
  inactive white slug. We are indebted to Forel and Duplessis for the discovery of this species, and
  also of <i>Otomesostoma morgiense</i>, a <i>Mesostoma</i> with an otolith, dredged in 10 to 50
  fathoms in the Lake of Geneva, the Lake of Z&uuml;rich, and found recently also by Zacharias in the
  Riesengebirge. The genus <i>Bothrioplana</i>, first found by Braun in the water-pipes of Dorpat,
  has been carefully investigated by Vejdovsky,<a id="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> who
  places it in a special family, Bothrioplanidae, among the Alloeocoela. One species has recently
  been found near Manchester.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive survey of the Rhabdocoelida shows that, with the chief exception of the
  Proboscidae, the more lowly organised forms, the Acoela and Alloeocoela, are marine, whereas the
  fresh-water forms are in most cases the most highly organised <span class="pagenum"
  id="page47"><span class="smaller">{47}</span></span>genera (<i>Mesostoma</i>, <i>Vortex</i>). But
  <i>Macrorhynchus helgolandicus</i>, though minute (1.5-2 mm. long), has a more complex structure<a
  id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> than any other species of the specialised marine
  genus to which it belongs, and is a remarkable instance of great complexity being associated with
  small size.</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;The Rhabdocoelida present the greatest diversity in the development
  of the reproductive system. The Acoela and Alloeocoela have the simplest arrangement. Scattered
  testes, often without a distinct membrane, form the spermatozoa, which in most cases wander into
  parenchymatous spaces, but in <i>Monoporus rubropunctatus</i> and <i>Bothrioplana</i>, into
  distinct vasa deferentia. In both groups a protrusible penis opens independently to the exterior,
  and may be simply muscular or provided with a chitinous armature. Two ovaries are present, and the
  oviducts, if distinct, are continuations of the ovarian membrane. In most forms a "bursa
  seminalis," which receives the spermatozoa of another individual, is appended to the female
  genital canal. In many of the Alloeocoela, however, a portion of the ovary is sterile, and its
  cells, forming a yolk-gland, feed the fertile portion, the whole structure being then spoken of as
  a germ-yolk-gland. In many others (Monotidae) this sterile part has become an independent
  yolk-gland, which communicates by yolk-ducts with the oviducts. The Acoela form no egg-case, the
  body of the parent becoming a bag for the ova, which elaborate their own food-yolk. The
  Alloeocoela lay hard-shelled eggs, which are produced in <i>Bothrioplana</i> and <i>Automolos</i>
  by the activity and interaction of reproductive organs, resembling closely those of certain
  Triclads.<a id="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Rhabdocoela exhibit every stage in the development of a complex reproductive system, from
  the simple ovaries and testes of a <i>Microstoma</i> or <i>Macrostoma</i>, to the intricate system
  of ducts and glands of a <i>Macrorhynchus</i> (Proboscidae), in which there is still much to be
  made out. The complications of the copulatory organs chiefly arise from the way in which the
  spermatozoa are brought into contact with a nutritive prostatic fluid, or are formed into
  spermatophores; and also from the penial armature, <span class="pagenum" id="page48"><span
  class="smaller">{48}</span></span>which is often very complex, and may consist of a curved
  chitinoid hook or a coiled loop (<i>Promesostoma</i>), of hooks (Proboscidae), or of an intricate
  arrangement of plates (<i>Proxenetes</i>); or the penis may take on a complex corkscrew-like form
  (<i>Pseudorhynchus</i>). The (frequently armed) female genital canal usually possesses a bursa
  seminalis for the fertilisation of the eggs, but a receptaculum seminis or spermatheca may serve
  for the reception, the bursa, for the lodgment of the spermatozoa of another individual. The
  fertilised ovum is provided with a supply of food-yolk and with a shell, which may be formed in a
  special diverticulum, the "uterus." The development of these organs strains the resources of the
  animal to the utmost, and in some Proboscidae the alimentary canal is squeezed out and
  disintegrates, in order to make room for them.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A few <i>Mesostoma</i> (<i>M. ehrenbergii</i>, <i>M. productum</i>, <i>M.
  lingua</i>) produce two kinds of eggs&mdash;thin- and thick-shelled. The latter are laid
  throughout the summer, and lie dormant through winter. The young which hatch in spring out of
  these "winter" eggs develop rapidly, and when only 7 to 8 mm. long (<i>i.e.</i> one-third the size
  of the parent) already possess functional genital organs; the penis, however, is rudimentary, and
  incapable of being used for copulation. Hence it is probable that this stunted progeny
  self-fertilise their thin-shelled or "summer" eggs. After the formation of these eggs the same
  parent is said (Schneider<a id="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>) to produce
  thick-shelled or winter eggs, but however that may be, the first young which hatch from the
  thin-shelled ova are produced in great numbers at a time (April to May) when food is abundant.
  These grow rapidly to the full size, and then having attained maturity, cross-fertilise one
  another's ova, which become encased in a thick brown shell; and it is these numerous "winter" eggs
  that lie dormant throughout the autumn and winter. Many <i>Mesostoma</i>, and practically all
  other Rhabdocoela, however, produce only thick-shelled eggs, and in all cases it is probable that
  to these many species owe their wide distribution, the exact range of which is, however, unknown,
  as is also the means of dispersal.</p>

  <p>From the Turbellaria we now pass on to a consideration of the second great subdivision of the
  Platyhelminthes, the Trematodes or "flukes," of which the "liver-fluke" is the best known, since
  it is one of the most dangerous parasites that infest domestic animals.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It has been pointed out that the Polyclads, Triclads, and Rhabdocoels are
  carnivorous, and that in each of these groups sporadic cases of parasitism occur. In other words,
  when the prey is much larger than the Turbellarian, the latter tends to become a parasite, and we
  can trace the development of the parasitic habit from the gradual association of Turbellaria with
  Ascidians, Crustacea, Molluscs, and Polyzoa merely for protective purposes, through the adoption,
  not only of the body of the host for shelter, but of its flesh for food; though it is only in some
  Rhabdocoels (<i>Graffilla</i>, etc.) that there exists a degeneration corresponding to the easier
  mode of nutrition and simpler life. The Trematodes,<a id="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> however, are wholly parasitic, either on the outer surface, the
  gills, or internal organs of their host, which is almost always a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page52"><span class="smaller">{52}</span></span>Vertebrate. Some Trematodes lodge in the
  mouth; others wander down the oesophagus into the stomach or intestine, where they fix themselves
  to the mucous membrane. Again, others work their way into the digestive glands by the ducts, and
  thus become further and further removed from the external world, and more adapted to live in the
  particular organs of that host in which they best flourish. The most important result of the
  adoption of this internal habitat by endoparasitic Trematodes is, however, seen in their
  life-history. If a liver-fluke were to deposit its million or so of eggs in the bile-ducts of the
  sheep, and these were to develop <i>in situ</i>, the host could not withstand the increased drain
  upon its vital resources, and host and parasites would perish together. Hence it is clear that the
  infection of a second host by Trematodes is highly necessary, whether they be
  <i>ectoparasitic</i>, in which case the infection is easily effected, when two hosts are in
  contact, by the adult worms, as well as when they are apart, by free-swimming larvae. In
  <i>endoparasitic</i> Trematodes it is brought about by the migration of the young to the outer
  world, their entrance into a, usually, Invertebrate host and their asexual multiplication within
  it, and the capture and deglutition of this "intermediate host" by the final Vertebrate one.
  Within the latter the immature parasites find out the organ in which their parents flourished, and
  here they too grow and attain maturity. The chances of any one egg of an endoparasitic Trematode
  producing eventually an adult are, therefore, far less favourable than in the case of an
  ectoparasitic form. In other words, while the former must lay a great number of small eggs, the
  latter need only deposit a (comparatively) few large ones, and this fact has a corresponding
  influence on the structure of the genitalia in the two cases. The Digenea, which employ two hosts
  in a lifetime, have accordingly a different generative mechanism from that of the Monogenea. The
  great need of the latter is a powerful apparatus for adhering to the surface of the body of its
  host; while the adaptations which the endoparasite requires are, in addition, (1) protection
  against the solvent action of the glands of its host, (2) the power of firm adhesion to a smooth
  internal surface, and (3) the ability not only to produce a large quantity of spermatozoa and ova,
  but in the absence of a fellow-parasite, to fertilise its own ova; and we find these conditions
  abundantly satisfied.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Trematoda monogenea</b> (<i>ectoparasitica</i>).</p>

  <p>There are four subdivisions of the Monogenea:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. <i>Temnocephalidae</i>, with four to twelve tentacles, and one sucker posteriorly (Fig.
  20).</p>

  <p>II. <i>Tristomatidae</i>, with two lateral, anteriorly-placed suckers. Oral suckers are absent,
  a large posterior sucker is constant, and is often armed with hooks (Fig. 22, C).</p>

  <p>III. <i>Polystomatidae</i>, with, usually, two oral suckers and a posteriorly-placed adhesive
  disc armed with suckers and hooks (Figs. 23 and 24).</p>

  <p class="sp3">IV. <i>Gyrodactylidae</i> (Fig. 29).</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Habits and Structure of Ectoparasitic Trematodes.</b></p>

  <p>I. <i>Temnocephalidae.</i>&mdash;These interesting forms, of which a good account has lately
  been written by Haswell,<a id="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> occur on the surface
  (rarely in the branchial chamber) of fresh-water crayfish and crabs in Australasia, the Malay
  Archipelago, Madagascar, and Chili. Others have been found on the carapace of a fresh-water
  tortoise, and in the branchial chamber of the mollusc <i>Ampullaria</i> from Brazil. Wood-Mason
  discovered others, again, in bottles containing spirit-specimens of Indian fish.
  <i>Temnocephala</i> is rarely more than a quarter of an inch long, and looks like a minute
  Cephalopod or a broad flattened <i>Hydra</i>. By the ventral sucker each species adheres to its
  own particular host, the tentacles being used as an anterior sucker for "looping" movements. The
  food, consisting of Entomostraca, Rotifera, and Diatoms, is first swallowed whole by the large
  pharynx (Fig. 20, <i>ph</i>), which can be protruded through the ventrally-placed mouth, and is
  then received into a simple lobed intestine (<i>d</i>). The skin, especially on the surface of the
  tentacles, is provided here and there with patches of cilia borne by the cellular
  epidermis,&mdash;the only undoubted case of external cilia occurring in an adult Trematode. Minute
  rhabdites formed in special gland-cells, occur plentifully on the tentacles, and are another
  distinctly Turbellarian feature. The excretory system is peculiar (Fig. 21). Fine ducts proceed
  from the various organs of the body, and open to the exterior by means of a pair of contractile
  sacs <span class="pagenum" id="page54"><span class="smaller">{54}</span></span>placed on the
  dorsal surface. Each sac is a single cell, and within it not one merely, but several "flames," or
  bunches of rhythmically contractile cilia, are present. These are placed on the course of
  excessively fine canals, which perforate the protoplasm of this cell. The terminal branches of the
  excretory canals end in branched cells, apparently devoid of "flames."</p>

  <p>The reproductive system is very similar to that of certain Rhabdocoels. An armed penis and the
  female genital duct open into a genital atrium, and this by a single aperture (&#x2640;, &#x2642;,
  Fig. 20) to the exterior. The fertilised ovum and yolk are enclosed in a stalked shell formed in
  the uterus.</p>

  <p>The interest and importance of the Temnocephalidae lies in the fact that they are almost as
  much Turbellaria as Trematodes. <span class="pagenum" id="page55"><span
  class="smaller">{55}</span></span>In habits, in the character of the skin, the muscular,
  digestive, and reproductive systems, they find their nearest allies in Rhabdocoels (Vorticidae).
  But in the excretory and nervous systems, the latter composed of two dorsal, two lateral, and two
  ventral trunks all connected together (Fig. 21), they are Tristomid Trematodes. Thus they may
  fitly connect an account of the two great groups.</p>

  attached to the gills, of fresh-water and marine fishes. The edible and inedible fish of our
  coasts have each their particular ectoparasitic Trematodes; while the Minnows, Sticklebacks, and
  Miller's Thumbs of streams and ponds are attacked by <i>Diplozoon</i>, <i>Gyrodactylus</i>, and
  other forms. The aquatic Amphibia also harbour a number. <i>Polystomum integerrimum</i> is common
  in the bladder of Frogs, where it leads a practically aquatic life. Other species of
  <i>Polystomum</i> inhabit the buccal and nasal cavities of certain Chelonia, but naturally no
  terrestrial Vertebrates are infested externally by these <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span
  class="smaller">{56}</span></span>Trematodes. The blood and epithelia of the host are sucked, and
  to this end the pharynx has frequently a chitinous armature to aid in the abrasion or inflammation
  of the tissues upon which the parasite feeds. In the case of a Sturgeon attacked by <i>Nitzschia
  elongata</i>, a Tristomid, the mouth of the host appeared to be highly inflamed by these attacks
  (v. Baer).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The suckers, in the two families under consideration, vary in number and complexity. There is
  always a powerful apparatus at the hinder end of the body securing the Trematode firmly to the
  slimy body or gills of its host, and, usually in the Polystomatidae, a pair of suckers at the
  sides of the mouth accessory to the pumping action of the pharynx. In <i>Axine</i>, and to a less
  extent in <i>Octobothrium</i> (Fig. 23), the suckers are strengthened by a complex hingework of
  chitinoid bars or hooks, which serve as insertions for the muscles of the suckers, and thus
  increase their efficiency.</p>

  <p>The mouth is invariably present just beneath the anterior end of the body. It leads into a
  muscular, pumping pharynx (Fig. 24, <i>ph</i>), and this into a bifurcated intestine which ends
  blindly. The two openings of the excretory system lie on the dorsal surface (as in
  <i>Temnocephala</i>), and the excretory canals branch through the substance of the body, ending
  usually in "flame-cells." The nervous system is highly developed, and resembles that of
  <i>Temnocephala</i> (Fig. 21) in detail. Upon the brain one or even two pairs of eye-spots are
  present in the larvae, and may persist throughout life. Tactile setae occur in <i>Sphyranura</i>,
  a parasite of the North American Amphibian <i>Necturus</i>, but a cellular epidermis is apparently
  rendered impossible, perhaps from the nature of <span class="pagenum" id="page57"><span
  class="smaller">{57}</span></span>the mucus in which the body is bathed, or to the attempts of the
  host to free itself from these parasites; and hence an investing membrane is present, which
  morphologically is either a modified epithelium, or a cuticle formed by the glandular secretion of
  the parenchyma.</p>

  <p>The reproductive organs of the Polystomatidae may be understood from Figs. 24, 27, and 28. At
  the point of union of the oviduct (Fig. 28, <i>ovd</i>), the vitelline ducts (<i>yd</i>), and the
  commencement of the uterus (<i>ut</i>), a slender duct is given off which opens into the
  intestine, and is known as the "vitello-intestinal canal" (Fig. 24, <i>dvi</i>; Fig. 28,
  <i>gic</i>). This duct has apparently the same relations as the "canal of Laurer" of Digenea,<a
  id="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> except only that the latter opens to the exterior
  directly. In connexion with this vitello-intestinal canal a "vagina" is present, which in
  <i>Polystomum</i> and most Monogenea is paired (Fig. 24, <i>vag</i>), in <i>Diplozoon</i> and in
  one <span class="pagenum" id="page58"><span class="smaller">{58}</span></span>or two other forms,
  however, unpaired. The vagina receives the penis of another individual during copulation (Fig.
  26), and does not appear to have an homologue in the liver-fluke or other Digenea.</p>

  <p><b>Life-Histories of the Polystomatidae.</b><a id="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Polystomum integerrimum.</i> After the mutual
  fertilisation of two individuals, the eggs are laid in the water by the protrusion of the body of
  the parent through the urinary aperture of the Frog. About 1000 eggs are laid in the spring at the
  rate of 100 a day for ten days. After about six weeks, the larva (.3 mm. long) hatches out, and
  swims about freely by means of bands of large ciliated cells (Fig. 26, A); but if it does not meet
  with a tadpole within twenty-four hours, it dies. Should it, however, encounter one, the larva
  creeps along it in a looping fashion until it approaches the opercular spout, or opening of the
  branchial chamber, on the left side; into this it darts suddenly, fixes itself, and throws off its
  cilia. Here it remains eight or ten weeks, feeding, increasing in size, and forming the suckers
  from behind forwards. <span class="pagenum" id="page59"><span class="smaller">{59}</span></span>At
  the time of the tadpole's metamorphosis, the young <i>Polystomum</i> works its way down the
  pharynx into the oesophagus and along the intestine, till it reaches and enters the opening of the
  bladder. Three years afterwards it becomes mature.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, however, <i>Polystomum</i> experiences another fate. The larvae settling down on the
  external gills of a young, recently-hatched tadpole, and obtaining a richer supply of blood than
  in the previous case, grow far more rapidly, so that in five weeks they are mature, although still
  in the branchial chamber of the tadpole. They do not then wander into the alimentary canal, but
  usually, having discharged their eggs, die at the time of the tadpole's metamorphosis. Still more
  interesting, however, is the difference between the genitalia in these and in the normal
  <i>Polystomum</i>. In contrast with the latter, these possess (1) one testis and a rudimentary
  penis; and their spermatozoa differ in structure and shape from those of the normal
  <i>Polystomum</i>. (2) The vaginae are absent, a fact connected with the absence of a functional
  copulatory organ. (3) In compensation for the loss of these, a duct connects the single testis and
  the point of union of oviduct and yolk-ducts, and by this self-fertilisation occurs. (4) The
  uterus is absent; the "ootype" or duct into which the shell-gland opens, communicating directly
  with the exterior. In (1) and (4) these aberrant <i>Polystomum</i> resemble <i>P. ocellatum</i>,
  from the Tortoise <i>Emys europaea</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Diplozoon paradoxum.</i>&mdash;The life-history of <i>Diplozoon</i> is unique. For whereas
  the larvae of most animals grow up, each into a single adult, in <i>Diplozoon</i>, of the few
  larvae that survive the dangers of their free-swimming existence, only those become mature which
  conjugate permanently with another individual. But although there are thus only half as many adult
  <i>Diplozoon</i> as there were conjugating larvae (or <i>Diporpa</i>, as they were called when
  they were considered distinct forms), yet the total number of eggs produced is probably as great
  as if each larva became individually mature.</p>

  <p><i>Diplozoon paradoxum</i> lays its eggs on the gills of the Minnow, which it frequently
  infests in great numbers. The ovum divides rapidly at the expense of the yolk-cells, and in a
  fortnight a larva (.2 mm. long) of the shape and complexity shown in Fig. 27, B, hatches out,
  which, however, succumbs if it does not meet with a Minnow in five or six hours. Should it
  survive, a dorsal papilla, a median ventral sucker, and a second pair of posterior suckers
  develop. Thus the <i>Diporpa</i> stage is attained. These <i>Diporpa</i> may acquire a third and
  even a fourth pair of suckers, and continue to live three months, but they only develop and mature
  their reproductive organs, if each conjugates with another <i>Diporpa</i> (Fig. 27, C, D), and
  this only occurs in a small percentage of instances. Each grasps the dorsal papilla of the other
  by its own ventral sucker, thus undergoing a certain amount of torsion. Where the two bodies
  touch, complete fusion occurs, and, as shown in Fig. 28, the united <i>Diporpa</i> (or
  <i>Diplozoon</i>, as the product is now called) decussate, each forming one limb of the X-shaped
  <i>Diplozoon</i>, within which the two sets of complex genitalia develop (Fig. 28).</p>

  <p class="sp3">IV. <i>Gyrodactylidae.</i>&mdash;<i>Gyrodactylus</i> (Fig. 29), the structure of
  which is in many ways peculiar, produces one large egg at a time. An embryo, in which the large
  and smaller hooks of the adhesive disc can be seen (<i>emb</i>), develops from this egg while
  still within the body of the parent, and may give rise to yet another generation within itself.
  The details of the process have not, however, been well ascertained.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Trematoda digenea</b> (<i>endoparasitica</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence and Habits of Digenea.</b>&mdash;Endoparasitic Trematodes have been found in
  almost all the organs of Vertebrate hosts excepting in the nervous, skeletal, and reproductive
  systems. The alimentary canal, however, is the most usual habitat. From the buccal cavity to the
  large intestine, or even to the cloaca, its different regions are the resorts of various
  Trematodes. No Digenea have been found in the mouth, pharynx, or oesophagus of Mammals; but in
  Birds, Reptiles, Amphibia, and especially in Fishes, these parts are largely affected. It is a
  striking fact that Trematodes should occur in the stomach of (chiefly) large predaceous fishes,
  such as the Pike, Sharks, the Angler-fish, and others, considering the powerful digestive action
  of the gastric juice of these carnivores. The peculiar nature of the defence which must be
  employed by the parasites against this digestive action, becomes still more marked when it is
  considered that if a Trematode normally living in the stomach of one host be transferred to that
  of another, it is usually speedily digested, as is shown (p. <a href="#page65">65</a>) in the case
  of <i>Distomum macrostomum</i>. From these considerations the suggestion has been made that the
  cutaneous secretions of these Trematodes must act, not only as a protection against digestive or
  other ferments, but that the action in each case must be a specific one (Frenzel, Braun).</p>

  <p>It is, however, in the small intestine that most Trematodes occur, as the examination of the
  common Frog<a id="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> will readily demonstrate. Both this
  and the edible Frog are attacked by a dozen Distomatidae, only a few of which, however, are common
  <span class="pagenum" id="page63"><span class="smaller">{63}</span></span>to both hosts, and a
  number of Holostomatidae also pass a stage of their development within these Amphibia. Some idea
  of the extent to which animals, whose habits lead to infection, may be attacked by Trematodes (to
  say nothing of Cestodes and Nematodes, which often occur also) may be gathered from the fact that
  in dissecting a black stork, Nathusius found several hundred <i>Holostomum excavatum</i> and about
  a hundred <i>Distomum ferox</i> in the small intestine, twenty-two <i>D. hians</i> in the
  oesophagus, five others in the stomach, and one <i>D. echinatum</i> in the intestine. Snipe,
  Woodcock, Sandpipers, Dunlin, Gulls, Bittern, Geese, and Wild Ducks are, to mention a few cases,
  greatly infested by members of this group.</p>

  <p><b>Life-histories of the Digenea.</b>&mdash;The classification of Trematodes according to their
  life-histories, expressed in the divisions Monogenea and Digenea, though a very useful one, breaks
  down entirely in the case of certain forms. Thus the life-history of <i>Gyrodactylus</i> is
  probably digenetic rather than monogenetic. <i>Aspidogaster conchicola</i>,<a id="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> which lives in the pericardial cavity of the fresh-water mussel
  (possibly the only case of a Trematode becoming normally mature in an Invertebrate host, since
  other species of <i>Aspidogaster</i> live in Chelonia), produces larvae which enter another
  <i>Anodonta</i> and develop directly into the sexual form. In other words, <i>Aspidogaster</i>,
  though structurally a digenetic form, possesses a life-history which is direct and simple,
  <i>i.e.</i> monogenetic.</p>

  <p>The Holostomatidae, which live in birds of prey and aquatic birds, give rise to eggs from which
  a minute larva escapes. The fate of this aquatic larva is not directly known, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page64"><span class="smaller">{64}</span></span>but in all probability after
  entering a host (Fish, Amphibian, Mollusc), it undergoes a gradual change into what has long been
  known as a <i>Tetracotyle</i>, from the frequent presence of four (sometimes only three) adhering
  organs. Fig. 31 exhibits a species which is abundant in the lens and vitreous humour of the eye of
  the Perch. Its further history is not known, but presumably the Perch is presently devoured by the
  final host in which the <i>Diplostomum</i> attains maturity. Thus the Holostomatidae are
  "metastatic" (Leuckart), their (probably) direct development requiring the presence of two
  hosts.<a id="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The other Digenea, the life-histories of which are known, belong to the Distomatidae and
  Amphistomatidae, and we may distinguish the steps by which the complex life-history of the
  liver-fluke (<i>Distomum hepaticum</i>) has been brought about, by a consideration of that of
  <i>Distomum macrostomum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Distomum macrostomum.</i>&mdash;This form occurs in the intestine of several common
  Passerine birds. It is remarkable not only for the large oral sucker, but also on account of the
  position of the common genital pore at the hinder, and not as usual, at the anterior, end of the
  body (Fig. 32, A). The eggs pass out through this pore, and are discharged with the bird's
  excrement. Should a certain snail (<i>Succinea putris</i>) happen to rasp off the epidermis of a
  leaf upon which the faeces have fallen, the eggs are swallowed and a minute active larva is set
  free (Fig. 32, B). This penetrates through the thin wall of the digestive tract of the snail, and
  passing into the connective tissue, throws off its cilia and assumes the shape of Fig. 32, C. This
  <i>sporocyst</i>, as the larva is now termed, grows rapidly in all directions (Fig. 32, D) at the
  expense of the snail's tissues, until it becomes impossible to separate parasite and host
  completely.</p>

  <p>Those branches which lie superficially in the cephalic region of the snail become greatly
  swollen, cylindrical, and contractile. They are banded with green and white, ornamented with red
  terminal spots, and pulsate rapidly. Hence these fertile branches of the sporocyst (which in this
  condition was known as <i>Leucochloridium paradoxum</i>, Fig. 33, B) naturally attract the
  attention of insectivorous birds, which peck off the tentacles of the snail, and with it the
  swollen sporocyst-branch. A sphincter muscle closes the cut end of the fertile sac when the bird's
  bill nips it off. The sac contains large numbers of young <i>D. macrostomum</i> (Fig. 32, A),
  produced by the division of embryonic cells of the larva (Fig. 32, B), which are apparently
  blastomeres of the egg reserved for this future use. It is a remarkable circumstance that the old
  bird itself is immune from infection, and if it swallows these young Distomes, they are digested.
  Should, however, the snail's tentacle and its contents be offered as food to the nestlings, their
  weaker digestive powers merely set the Distomes free from the protective membranes (Fig. 32, A),
  and thus the Blackcaps, Sparrows, and other birds infested by <i>D. macrostomum</i> have acquired
  the parasite when they were <span class="pagenum" id="page66"><span

  <p>The egg of this Distome thus gives rise to a larva which enters the tissues of one particular
  Mollusc. Here it becomes a branched sporocyst within which the sexual worms are formed, apparently
  each from a single embryonic blastomere ("Keimzelle"), by a process comparable with the
  development of a parthenogenetic ovum, and the whole cycle has been termed <i>Alloiogenesis</i>,
  <i>i.e.</i> alternation of sexual and parthenogenetic generations (Grobben).<a id="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> Leuckart<a id="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and

  metamorphosis of an individual (as in the <span class="pagenum" id="page67"><span
  class="smaller">{67}</span></span>Holostomatidae) has now become, by maturation of the Cercaria in
  the comparatively modern warm-blooded bird, a metamorphosis extending over two or more
  generations.</p>

  <p><i>Distomum (Fasciola) hepaticum.</i>&mdash;The liver-fluke of the Sheep, which produces the
  disastrous disease, liver-rot, has a distribution as wide as that of a small water-snail,
  <i>Limnaea truncatula</i>, the connexion between the two being, as Thomas<a id="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> and Leuckart discovered, that this snail is the intermediate
  host in which the earlier larval, sporocyst, and redia stages are passed through, and a vast
  number of immature flukes (Cercariae) are developed. These leave the snail and encyst upon grass,
  where they are eaten by the sheep. Over the whole of Europe, Northern Asia, Abyssinia, and North
  Africa, the Canaries, and the Faroes, the fluke and the snail are known to occur, and recently the
  former has been found in Australia and the Sandwich Islands, where a snail, apparently a variety
  of <i>Limnaea truncatula</i>, is also found.<a id="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> Over
  these vast areas, however, the disease usually only occurs in certain marshy districts and at
  certain times of the year. Meadows of a clayey soil, liable to be flooded (as in certain parts of
  Oxfordshire), are the places where this <i>Limnaea</i> occurs most abundantly, and these are
  consequently the most dangerous feeding-grounds for sheep. The wet years 1816, 1817, 1830, 1853,
  and 1854&mdash;memorable for the occurrence of acute liver-rot in England, Germany, and
  France&mdash;showed that the weather also plays a considerable part in extending the suitable
  ground for <i>Limnaea</i> over wide areas, which in dry years may be safe pastures. In 1830
  England lost from this cause,<a id="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> one and a half
  million sheep, representing some four millions of money, while in 1879-80 three millions died. In
  1862 Ireland lost 60 per cent of the flocks, and in 1882 vast numbers of sheep perished in Buenos
  Ayres from this cause. In the United Kingdom the annual loss was formerly estimated at a million
  animals, but is now probably considerably less. After infection during a wet autumn, it is usually
  in the succeeding winter that the disease reaches its height.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page68"><span class="smaller">{68}</span></span></div>

  <p>The symptoms of "rot" appear about a month after infection, more acutely in lambs than in
  sheep, and again, less in oxen than in sheep. At first, death may result from cerebral apoplexy,
  but if the first few weeks are passed through, a pernicious anaemia sets in, the sheep are less
  lively and fall at a slight touch, the appetite diminishes, and rumination becomes irregular. The
  conjunctiva is of a whitish-yellow colour, the dry, brittle wool falls off, and there is sometimes
  fever and quickened respiration. In January, about three months after infection, the wasting, or
  fatal, period sets in. Oedemas or swellings, usually visible before, become larger at the
  dependent parts of the body, a large one in the submaxillary region being especially well marked,
  and this is considered one of the most characteristic symptoms ("watery poke"). Through this
  period few of the infected sheep survive, but should they do so, the flukes begin to migrate,
  though some remain much longer within the liver. Migration is effected through the bile-duct into
  the duodenum and outwith the faeces, in which the altered remains of the <i>Distomum</i> are
  sometimes scarcely recognisable. Under these circumstances (or owing to death of the fluke <i>in
  situ</i>) the sheep recover more or less fully.</p>

  <p>The preventive measures seem to be: (1) Destruction of the eggs and of the manure of rotten
  sheep; (2) slaughter of badly fluked sheep; (3) adequate drainage of pastures; (4) an allowance of
  salt and a little dry food to the sheep; and (5) dressings of lime or salt on the ground to
  destroy the embryos.<a id="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Distomum hepaticum</i>, contrary to most Trematodes, enjoys a wide range of hosts. Man
  himself occasionally falls a victim; thus in Dalmatia, in the Narenta Valley, the disease is
  endemic but slight in its effects. The horse, deer, camel, antelopes, goat, pig, rabbit, kangaroo,
  beaver, and squirrel have all been known to harbour this fluke occasionally. In the Italian
  deer-parks at Mandria a large species, <i>D. magnum</i>, decimated the herds some years ago; and
  this species, probably imported from Italy, is now almost as dangerous a parasite on the western
  plains of the United States as <i>D. hepaticum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Bilharzia haematobia.</i><a id="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>&mdash;This
  formidable parasite was discovered by Bilharz in 1853 in the veins of the bladder of patients
  <span class="pagenum" id="page69"><span class="smaller">{69}</span></span>at the Cairo Hospital,
  and is remarkable from its abundance on the east coast and inland countries of Africa from Egypt
  to the Cape, as well as in the districts bordering Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi river, while
  westwards it occurs on the Gold Coast. Mecca is a source of infection whence Mohammedans carry the
  disease to distant places. In Egypt about 30 per cent of the native population is affected by the
  serious disease known as Haematuria, resulting from the attacks of <i>Bilharzia</i>, so that, of
  the many scourges from which in Africa man suffers, this one is perhaps the most severe.</p>

  <p>The worm is found usually in couples, which have been proved to be male and female individuals
  (Fig. 34), often in considerable numbers in the veins of the pelvic region, chiefly the veins of
  the bladder and of the large intestine, and it is tolerably certain that <i>Bilharzia</i> enter
  these vessels from the portal vein. Their long slender bodies enable them to penetrate into the
  finer vessels, which get partially or entirely choked up, and the circulation accordingly impeded.
  But the most serious consequences are observed in the urinary bladder. The mucous membrane is
  swollen and inflamed here and there, chiefly on the dorsal surface, the capillaries appear
  varicose and covered with mucus, mixed with blood-extravasations in which <i>Bilharzia</i>-eggs
  are noticeable. The eggs also cause numerous swollen knots in the submucous tissue. Should the
  disease not pass beyond this stage (and such is usually the case, especially in South Africa), a
  temporary haematuria ensues. The urine, which is only expelled with great effort, accompanied by
  intense pain, is mixed with blood, mucous clots, and masses of <i>Bilharzia</i>-eggs, from which
  some of the embryos have already hatched out. The symptoms, however, may gradually pass away, and
  a more or less complete recovery accomplished. The disease may indeed be of a far less severe
  character, and may not interfere with the usual occupations of the patient; but, on <span
  class="pagenum" id="page70"><span class="smaller">{70}</span></span>the other hand, a far more
  extensive thickening of the wall of the bladder sometimes occurs; hard masses of eggs, uric acid
  crystals, and other deposits, may lead to the formation of stones, degeneration of the substance
  of the ureter, and eventually to that of the kidney itself. The stone, indeed, has long been known
  to be a prevalent disease in Egypt, and it is now known to arise from concretions formed round
  masses of <i>Bilharzia</i> eggs. From the portal vein, again, other <i>Bilharzia</i> may gain
  access to the rectum, or the liver, and it has also been found in the lungs, and may give rise to
  most serious complications, if indeed the patient lives.</p>

  <p>How infection occurs is a question to which at present no satisfactory answer can be made. The
  attempt to introduce embryos of <i>Bilharzia</i> into the common fresh-water animals of Alexandria
  has hitherto proved fruitless (Looss<a id="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>), although
  there seems little doubt that the comparative immunity of Europeans from the disease is in some
  way owing to their drinking purer water than the natives. Possibly, as Leuckart suggests, the
  embryo becomes a sporocyst in man himself, somewhat as <i>Taenia murina</i> is known to develop in
  the rat without an intermediate host.<a id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> The immense
  numbers of the parasite in one host would then readily receive an explanation.</p>

  <p>A <i>Bilharzia</i>, possibly <i>B. haematobia</i>, was found by Cobbold in the portal vein of
  <i>Cercopithecus fuliginosus</i>; and <i>B. crassa</i> infests the cattle of Egypt, Sicily, and
  certain parts of India, but does not produce haematuria.</p>

  <p>Of the other Trematodes of man and domestic animals there is not room to speak fully.
  <i>Distomum pulmonale</i>, which occurs in the lungs of the cat, tiger, and dog, as well as in
  man, is especially common in Japan, China, Corea, and Formosa. <i>D. sinense</i> and <i>D.
  rathouisi</i> have been also found in inhabitants of these countries.</p>

  <p><b>Bisexual Trematodes.</b>&mdash;Zoologically, <i>Bilharzia</i> is interesting from its
  bisexual condition. It is not, however, the only bisexual Trematode. In cysts in the branchial
  chamber of Ray's bream, <i>Brama raii</i>, two worms are found, which are probably the slender
  male and the swollen female of the same species (<i>Distomum okenii</i>). The only doubt that can
  arise proceeds from the tendency in all Trematodes for the male organs to ripen before <span
  class="pagenum" id="page71"><span class="smaller">{71}</span></span>the female organs. Until we
  certainly know that the swollen egg-bearing form (&#x2640;) does not arise from a previously male
  form (&#x2642;), the case is open to suspicion. Since, however, K&ouml;lliker<a id="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> never found intermediate hermaphrodite conditions, this
  <i>Distomum</i> may be almost certainly regarded as of distinct sexes. <i>Didymozoon thynni</i>
  (<i>Monostomum bipartitum</i>), from cysts on the gills of the Tunny (<i>Thynnus</i>), is another
  case. Two slender worms flattened posteriorly, come together, and the body of one becomes folded
  to receive that of the other. They fuse completely except for a small lateral opening through
  which the anterior parts of both worms may freely protrude. The enclosing individual contains a
  coiled uterus filled with eggs, and is the female, whereas the smaller individual never possesses
  eggs, and is probably the male.<a id="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>
  <i>Nematobothrium</i> (Fig. 22, A), which occurs also in the Tunny, in the form of two immensely
  long individuals intricately wound about each other in a cyst, is, however, not bisexual.</p>

  <p>The Cestodes or Tape-worms are exclusively endoparasitic Platyhelminthes living, in the adult
  condition, in the alimentary canal of Vertebrates, with the exception of <i>Archigetes</i> (Fig.
  37), which may become mature in the body-cavity of <i>Tubifex</i>. In relation with this wholly
  parasitic existence, the Cestodes exhibit certain characteristic modifications in structure and
  mode of development, such as the formation, by the segmentation of the "neck," of a (usually) long
  chain of "proglottides" or joints, which form the "body" of the Cestode; and the entire absence of
  an alimentary tract, both in the larva and adult. As an adaptation to the fixed mode of life, the
  anterior end (head, scolex) is modified to form an adhering organ. Various adaptive forms of
  larvae are known. These live in the internal organs of one or more intermediate hosts, and are
  transferred to the final host passively during a meal. Lastly, there is the curious metamorphosis
  by which the adult is formed from a portion (scolex) of the larva.<a id="NtA_94"

  <p><i>Taenia solium</i>, from man (Fig. 39, B), or <i>Echinobothrium</i> (Fig. 36), from an
  Elasmobranch fish, is fixed to the mucous lining of the intestine of its host by means of a
  radially-constructed apparatus of four suckers and a circlet of hooks (Fig. 39), which are borne
  by the "head" or "scolex," being that part of the worm which is directly derived from part of the
  larva, and which contains the central, commissural portion of the nervous system. Firm adhesion to
  the host's intestine is necessary, in order to avoid the loosening action of the peristaltic
  movements of the intestine as the food passes along. The heads of different Cestodes exhibit a
  marvellous variety of suckers and hooks, from a mere muscular depression in
  <i>Schistocephalus</i>, to the compound proboscides of <i>Tetrarhynchus</i><a id="NtA_96"
  href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> which is found in Elasmobranchs. The jointed body, often of
  enormous length (up to 20 yards in <i>Bothriocephalus latus</i>), is usually separated from the
  head by a slender neck, from which the proglottides are segmented off from behind forwards, and
  become more and more individualised as they recede farther away from the neck by the intercalation
  of younger joints. Thus in Fig. 36 the mature, distal proglottis has passed through all the stages
  represented by the other segments.</p>

  <p>The longitudinal muscles, the nerves, and excretory vessels which supply the proglottides are
  continuous throughout and with those of the head. Each joint contains at first male genitalia
  comparable with those of a Trematode; then the female organs develop, and finally
  self-fertilisation follows. The Cestodes feed through their skin, probably by the aid of fine
  protoplasmic processes, which penetrate the tough investing membrane and absorb the already
  digested food which bathes them. When a proglottis of <i>Calliobothrium</i> is approaching
  maturity it separates from the parent, the broken ends of muscles, nerves, and excretory vessels
  speedily heal, and it is now capable of continued growth and of fairly active movement if it
  remains in the intestine of the host. According to van Beneden, it may even attain a size equal
  to, or exceeding, that of the whole parent or "strobila."<a id="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> These considerations led Leuckart, von Siebold, P. J. van
  Beneden, and others, to Steenstrup's conclusion that a jointed tape-worm is really a colony
  composed of two generations&mdash;the head and neck derived from the larva, and the proglottides
  produced by the segmentation of the neck.<a id="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> This
  view of the colonial nature of jointed Cestodes was generally adopted from 1851 to 1880. During
  the last fifteen years, however, the varied interpretations of the facts of the ontogeny of this
  group have led some authors to adopt the monozootic view (that a Cestode is one individual),
  others are still of the older opinion, and Hatschek (<i>Lehrbuch</i>, p. 349) and Lang take up
  intermediate positions. Lang considers that the formation of the joints of a tape-worm from a
  small fixed "scolex," is not only largely comparable with the strobilation of a <i>scyphistoma</i>
  and the consequent formation of a pile of medusae, as in the life-history of <i>Aurelia</i>, but
  <span class="pagenum" id="page77"><span class="smaller">{77}</span></span>that both processes have
  arisen from the power of regenerating the necessary organs in each of the new segments. The result
  in both cases is the rapid formation of a number of joints, which gradually separate from the
  parent, to carry the eggs and young to new stations. Just as some Coelenterata (<i>Lucernaria</i>)
  may be regarded as not having advanced much beyond a scyphistoma stage, so there are unisegmental
  Cestodes (e.g. <i>Archigetes</i>, Fig. 37) which have remained as a slightly altered but sexual
  scolex, directly comparable with a Trematode, and, as all authors are agreed, representing one
  generation only. Such monozootic forms are now classed as a special family, the Cestodaria or
  Monozoa, of which <i>Caryophylleus mutabilis</i>, from the intestine of various Cyprinoid fish, is
  the most abundant representative, while <i>Amphiptyches</i> (<i>Gyrocotyle</i>) <i>urna</i>, from
  <i>Chimaera monstrosa</i> of the northern hemisphere, is paralleled by <i>A. rugosa</i>, found in
  <i>Callorhynchus antarcticus</i> of the southern seas.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence of Cestodes.</b>&mdash;The distribution of Cestodes and their larvae is analogous
  to that of the digenetic Trematodes, although the absence of an alimentary canal limits the
  habitat of the mature worms to certain sites, such as the blood-vessels, the lymphatic and
  coelomic spaces, and the digestive system, where their body may be bathed by a nutritive fluid.
  Almost all groups of Vertebrates are attacked by Cestodes. Those of fishes, and particularly of
  Elasmobranchs, are distinguished by certain structural and developmental features; those of birds
  by <span class="pagenum" id="page78"><span class="smaller">{78}</span></span>others; those of
  mammals, by a third set of characters. The young stages of the Cestodes of Sharks and Rays occur
  encysted in the body-cavity, or in the pyloric appendages, of Teleosteans, which probably swallow
  them along with those invertebrate animals upon which they prey. The larvae of the Cestodes of
  carnivorous mammals or piscivorous birds, live respectively in herbivores and fishes, but how the
  latter are infected we know in very few instances. Cestode larvae are known to occur in many
  Invertebrates, and occasionally are taken free swimming in the sea, presumably crossing from one
  host to the next. Ctenophores, Siphonophores, Copepods, Ostracods, Decapods, various Molluscs
  especially Cephalopods, Earthworms, and other Annelids, are the intermediate hosts of these larvae
  (see Fig. 38), the fate of which, however, has been determined in but few cases.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence of Cestodes in Man.</b><a id="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>&mdash;Tape-worms, either in the adult or larval stages
  (bladder-worms), have, from ancient times, been known to occur in man, and in the animals that
  serve him as food. Until comparatively recent times, however, the true nature of these parasites,
  and particularly of "hydatids" (cystic larvae), was unrecognised. Up to the seventeenth century
  the larvae were regarded as abscesses or diseased growths of the affected organs, and it was only
  at the close of that century that their animal nature was even suggested. Even at the beginning of
  the nineteenth century, three modes of origin of Cestodes&mdash;by "generatio aequivoca" from the
  tissues of the body, or by the union of previously distinct proglottides, or again by
  metamorphosis of free-living worms drunk with water by cattle or birds (as Linnaeus
  suggested)&mdash;were still variously held, at a time when Malpighi, Pallas, and Goeze had
  recognised the true connexion between the cystic and segmented states of <i>Taenia
  crassicollis</i> (the cat tape-worm), and when Goeze had seen the eggs of <i>Taeniae</i>, and
  Abildgaard<a id="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> had even conducted the first
  helminthological experiments (conversion of the larval <i>Schistocephalus</i>, Fig. 40, into the
  adult form).</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, "a tape-worm" in Western Europe will prove to be <i>Taenia saginata</i>
  Goeze (the beef tape-worm, Fig. 39, A), exceedingly prevalent also in the East, and indeed
  cosmopolitan, occurring wherever the infected flesh of the ox is eaten in a raw or half-cooked
  state. Its attacks are fortunately not usually severe. <i>Taenia solium</i> Rud. (the pork
  tape-worm) is found wherever the pig is kept as a domestic animal, and has consequently a
  world-wide distribution. Its size (6-9 feet long) and powers of adhesion would alone render <i>T.
  solium</i> a formidable parasite. But the danger of its presence in the body of man, or in the
  flesh of pigs, lies in the fact that the larva or bladder-worm (known as <i>Cysticercus
  cellulosae</i>) can live in the most varied organs. Thus if by accident a mature proglottis be
  eaten, the embryos escape, bore their way into the wall of the stomach, and entering the portal
  vein, may reach in time the muscles, the brain, the eye, or even the heart itself, and attain the
  cystic condition. Even more disastrous may be the result, should some ripe joints of a mature worm
  work their way from the intestine back towards the stomach. Should this happen (and though it has
  not been directly proved, the possibility is to be reckoned with), the result would be the release
  of vast numbers of embryos capable of inflicting fatal injury on the host. An abnormal
  <i>Cysticercus</i> of this species is probably the <i>Taenia</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page80"><span class="smaller">{80}</span></span>(<i>Cysticercus</i>) <i>acanthotrias</i>
  Weinl. (see, however, Leuckart, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 711).</p>

  <p><i>Taenia</i> (<i>Hymenolepis</i>) <i>nana</i> v.&nbsp;Sieb.<a id="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> is found in man in Egypt, Italy, England, Servia, Argentine
  Republic, and the United States. Though small (&frac34;-1 inch long), its numbers usually excite
  digestive and nervous disorders of considerable severity, more serious, indeed, than those caused
  by the commoner tape-worms. <i>H. diminuta</i> Rud. (<i>flavopunctata</i> Weinl.), normally found
  in Rodents, has been rarely recorded in man. <i>Taenia</i> (<i>Dipylidium</i>) <i>caninum</i> L.
  (= <i>T. cucumerina</i> Bloch = <i>T. elliptica</i> Batsch), the commonest parasite of pet cats
  and dogs, and <i>T.</i> (<i>Davainea</i>) <i>madagascariensis</i> Davaine, have occasionally been
  recorded from infants and young children. But the attacks of these species are insignificant in
  comparison with those of the cystic stage (<i>Echinococcus polymorphus</i>) of a tape-worm (<i>T.
  echinococcus</i> v.&nbsp;Sieb.) which lives when mature in the dog.</p>

  <p><i>Echinococcus</i> is most frequent in Iceland, where it affects 2 to 3 per cent of the
  population, and a still larger proportion of sheep; while in Copenhagen, Northern Germany, some
  districts of Switzerland, and Victoria it is not uncommon, but is frequently found during
  <i>post-mortem</i> examinations when no definite symptoms of its presence had been previously
  noticed. <i>Echinococcus</i><a id="NtA_102" href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> varies greatly in
  size, form, and mode of growth, but is distinguished in the formation not of one scolex only, as
  in the <i>Cysticercus</i>, but in the production of a number of vesicles, usually from the inner
  wall. Within these, large numbers of scolices may be developed. The whole organism continues to
  swell by the formation of a watery liquid within it, and if its growth be rapid the fluid tension
  may cause the rupture of the enclosing connective-tissue capsule formed around the parasite, at
  the expense of the host, and the protrusion of the daughter vesicles. It is the consequent injury
  to the surrounding organs of the host, at this critical stage, often only reached after the lapse
  of several years, that occasions serious or even fatal results. Zoologically, <i>Taenia
  echinococcus</i> and <i>T. coenurus</i> are interesting, since they exhibit an <span
  class="pagenum" id="page81"><span class="smaller">{81}</span></span>indubitable alternation of
  asexual generations in the larval state, with a sexual adult stage.</p>

  <p><i>Bothriocephalus latus</i> Brems., the broad tape-worm, which attains a length of 20-30 feet,
  or even more, occurs in man endemically in the eastern Baltic provinces, certain parts of
  Switzerland, generally throughout Russia (especially near Kasan), in North America, and commonly
  in Japan,&mdash;that is, in districts where the population partake largely of pike or other fish
  in a raw or partially-cooked state. Elsewhere it occurs sporadically, and in Munich, where it was
  unknown before 1880, its presence has been traced to emigrants from infected districts, who
  settled on the shores of the Starenberger Lake, from which Munich was supplied with fish. How the
  pike, the usual but not invariable intermediate host, becomes infested (and its musculature is
  frequently riddled with the larvae) we do not accurately know, but some Invertebrate, the prey of
  the pike, is probably the first host into which the free-swimming ciliated larva (Fig. 42) finds
  its way. In Greenland, <i>B. cordatus</i> is very common in the dog, and probably also in man,
  though few cases have been recorded. <i>B. mansoni</i> Cobb. (= <i>B. liguloides</i> Leuck.) was,
  till recently, known only in the larval state from China and Japan. Iijima, however, has found
  older specimens in the latter country. <i>B. cristatus</i> Dav. is a species founded somewhat
  doubtfully on two fragments found, one in a child, the other in a man, in France.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence of Cestodes in Domestic Animals.</b><a id="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>&mdash;Among domestic animals, the dog is, undoubtedly, the
  most frequently attacked by Taeniae. Six species of <i>Taenia</i> (<i>T. serrata</i>,
  <i>marginata</i>, <i>coenurus</i>, <i>echinococcus</i>, <i>krabbei</i>, and possibly <i>T.
  serialis</i>), <i>Dipylidium caninum</i> (the commonest form), <i>Mesocestoides lineatus</i>, and
  three or four species of <i>Bothriocephalus</i> have been found in the dog. The table of
  life-histories (p. <a href="#page83">83</a>) shows that sheep, rabbits and other Rodents serve as
  the intermediate hosts, in which the cystic stages of the species of <i>Taenia</i> are found.
  Hence the prevalence of <i>T. serrata</i> in a given locality is connected with the abundance
  there of the rabbit and hare, in which the larva (<i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i>) occurs.
  <i>Bothriocephalus cordatus</i> develops from the young stage present in the fish which the
  Icelanders give to their dogs. In Iceland and certain parts of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page82"><span class="smaller">{82}</span></span>Australia <i>T. echinococcus</i> infests
  one-third to one-half the number of dogs examined; a fact connected with the frequency of
  <i>Echinococcus</i> in man in these countries.</p>

  <p>In sheep the most noteworthy and dangerous parasite is <i>Coenurus cerebralis</i> (or the
  cystic stage of the dog-taenia, <i>T. coenurus</i>), which gives rise to the disease known as
  "gid" or "staggers." It is found in various parts of the brain or spinal cord, and the symptoms
  differ according to the position of the parasite. If this presses upon one hemisphere the sheep
  describes circles and finally falls: if on the optic lobes, the eyes are affected: if the pressure
  affects the cerebellum the movements of the sheep are uncertain and incoordinated. Four or six
  weeks after the appearance of the symptoms, death results from cerebral paralysis, or from general
  debility, and the loss of sheep incurred by this disease (happily less frequent in England than
  formerly) has been calculated by Youatt at a million for France annually; at 35 per cent of the
  flocks for England in bad seasons; and about 2 per cent for Germany. Besides sheep, which are most
  subject to "gid" during their first year, various ruminants&mdash;Goat, Ox, Moufflon, Chamois,
  Roe, Antelope, Reindeer, Dromedary&mdash;are attacked in the same way. A similar form, <i>Coenurus
  serialis</i> Baill., is common in the wild rabbit in this country, and in Australia in the hare
  and squirrel. It forms large swellings in the connective tissue of various parts of the body, but
  usually does not affect the health of the host. It is not known in what carnivore <i>Taenia
  serialis</i> Baill. normally occurs. Experiments have, however, shown that it develops rapidly in
  dogs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The preventive measures which are steadily diminishing the prevalence of the
  Cestode parasites in man in some parts of Western Europe cannot be dealt with here, but it may be
  noticed that the Jewish observance with regard to swine is the surest preventive measure against
  taeniasis and trichinosis. Careful inspection of meat and general cleanliness, are the leading
  measures that in these hygienic matters secure the greatest immunity from disease.</p>

  <p><b>Structure and Development of Cestoda.</b><a id="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>&mdash;Of the unsegmented Cestodes, <i>Caryophyllaeus
  mutabilis</i>, from the intestine of carp and other Cyprinoid fishes, is the most easily
  accessible form. <i>Triaenophorus nodulosus</i>, which is very useful for the study of the
  excretory system, occurs mature in the pike. In the body-cavity of the Stickleback (Fig. 40) a
  large, broad, yellow worm may sometimes <span class="pagenum" id="page85"><span
  class="smaller">{85}</span></span>be found, the larva of <i>Schistocephalus solidus</i> Crepl.,
  which occurs in the intestine of Terns, Storks, Mergansers, and other birds. Species of
  <i>Ligula</i> are found in the same birds. The intestine of a <i>Lophius</i> or <i>Cyclopterus</i>
  ("lump-fish") contains, usually, the early and intermediate stages of various Cestodes, while the
  alimentary canal of Elasmobranchs often contain many peculiar Tetrarhynchidae and other forms. For
  the study of development, the <i>Taenia anatina</i> from the duck may be used. The ripe
  proglottides are collected, and the eggs placed with <i>Cypris ovum</i> in an aquarium, with the
  probability that some of the embryos will enter the Ostracod, and the peculiar Cysticercoid may be
  bred.<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> <i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i> and
  <i>Coenurus serialis</i>, which occur commonly in rabbits, are also suitable objects for
  examination.</p>

  <p>A Cestode such as <i>Echinobothrium</i> (Fig. 36) is divisible into head and proglottides.
  Moniez has suggested that the head is really the morphologically hinder end of the body, in which
  case the formation of proglottides would closely resemble the mode of segmentation of an Annelid
  larva. The close similarity, however, between the Cysticercoid larva (Fig. 43, F) and the Cercaria
  of a liver-fluke, seems to show that the anterior end is the same in both cases, and since it
  bears the central part of the nervous system, we may reasonably call it the "head." Moreover the
  hinder end of a Platyhelminth usually possesses the chief excretory pore. Another difficulty is
  the determination of dorsal and ventral surfaces. Authors are agreed,&mdash;on the analogy of
  Trematodes, in which the testes are usually dorsal and the ovaries ventral,&mdash;that the dorsal
  and ventral aspects of a Cestode are determined by the position of these organs, although the
  often radially formed "head," the lateral or superficial position of the genital apertures, and
  the variability of these features, render it a matter of considerable doubt whether "dorsal" and
  "ventral" are more than useful conventional terms. The suckers and hooks are borne on a muscular
  cap, the "rostellum," which is only slightly developed in the <i>Ichthyotaeniae</i>. The body is
  solid, and is divisible into an outer muscular coat&mdash;enveloped in a (possibly epidermal)
  investing membrane&mdash;and an inner parenchymatous tissue containing the chief part of the
  excretory, nervous, and reproductive systems. One or two pairs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>of longitudinal excretory vessels are present,
  usually connected by transverse ducts and opening by a single terminal pore. Occasionally a
  regularly paired arrangement of lateral or secondary pores is present (Figs. 38 and 41,
  <i>for.sec</i>). Flame-cells occur at the end of the fine tubules (Fig. 38), and the whole system
  is well developed, but may undergo degenerative changes in the older proglottides. The central
  nervous system varies according to the degree of differentiation of the rostellum; and, owing to
  the difficulty of staining the nerves and the contradictory statements of authors, we do not yet
  possess a fully reliable account of the nervous system even of the commoner Taeniae. Free nerve
  endings and other sensory terminations have been recently stated to exist in the cuticle of
  Cestodes and Trematodes. If true, this would tend to show that the parasitic mode of life of these
  animals demands a complex nervous system comparable with that of the Turbellaria.</p>

  <p>The reproductive organs, unlike the preceding systems, are discontinuous from one proglottis to
  the next. The male and female organs and their mutual connexions, especially in the unsegmented
  Cestodes, may be compared in detail with those of Trematodes, but the difference between the
  arrangement of the generative organs of various Cestodes is very great.<a id="NtA_107"

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;<b>A</b>, Free-swimming, six-hooked
      larva of <i>Bothriocephalus latus</i> Brems. (the broad tape-worm of Man), still enclosed in a
      ciliated (possibly cellular) double membrane or mantle. In this condition it may continue to
      live in water for a week or more, but eventually throws off its ciliated coat (as in <b>B</b>)
      and commences to creep about vigorously by the aid of its hooks, in search of its first host,
      which is at present unknown. (After Schauinsland.) &times; 600.</p>

  <p>From this fact and the anatomical relations of the vagina, it is becoming increasingly probable
  that the so-called uterus of Trematodes is an organ corresponding to the vagina of Cestodes, and
  not to the uterus of Cestodes. The latter opens to the exterior in <i>Schistocephalus</i>,
  <i>Bothriocephalus</i>, and some other Cestodes of fishes by a special pore (Fig. 41, <i>uto</i>).
  Through this, some of the eggs (which in these genera give rise to ciliated larvae) are enabled to
  escape, and need not wait for the detachment of the proglottis, as must happen in the Taeniidae,
  where the uterus is closed. This uterus, a true physiological one, is probably the homologue of
  the "canal of Laurer" ("Laurer-Stieda canal," or "vagina") of Trematoda. The fertilised ovum and
  yolk are brought together into the "ootype," where the shell-gland forms the egg-shell around them
  (Fig. 41, <i>sh.gl</i>) and the egg is then passed into the uterus. The ovum segments to form a
  minute six-hooked larva, which may (Bothriidae, Fig. 42) or may not (Taeniidae) be ciliated. Thus
  in <i>Taenia serrata</i> the proglottides are shed with the faeces of the host (dog), and they
  protect the young from the desiccating influence of the surroundings. If inadvertently eaten by a
  rabbit along with herbs, the proglottis and larval envelope are digested, and by its six hooks the
  tiny larva bores through the gastric wall into the portal vein, and so into the liver. Here the
  hooks are thrown off, and the solid mass of cells becomes vacuolated.</p>

  <p class="sp3">At one pole an invagination occurs, at the bottom of which the rostellum, suckers,
  and hooks are gradually formed, but inside out as compared with the head of the <i>Taenia
  serrata</i>. At this stage the larva (<i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i>) has usually issued from the
  liver and attached itself to the omentum. The invagination projects into the cavity of the
  bladder, within which a watery fluid accumulates. Thus the "bladder worm" is formed, the head of
  which is evaginated if the larva be introduced into the digestive system of a dog. The bladder and
  neck of invagination are digested, while the head, protected by these, remains, and forms the
  neck, from which the proglottides are afterwards segmented off. In <i>Taenia</i>
  (<i>Hymenolepis</i>) <i>murina</i> the whole development may take place in the parental host, the
  larva living in the villi, the adults in the cavity of the same rat's intestine (Grassi). The
  different forms of Cestode larvae depend largely upon the presence and degree of development of
  the caudal vesicle or bladder, which in <i>Scolex polymorphus</i> (Fig. 38) (the young stage of
  <i>Calliobothrium filicolle</i> Zsch.) is practically absent. If the bladder be small, the larva
  is known as a Cysticercoid. For example, the common <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>, which lives in the
  dog, has such a larva, the development of which is explained and illustrated by Figs. 43 and 44.
  The bladder becomes exceeding capacious in <i>Coenurus</i> and <i>Echinococcus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Mesozoa are an obscure group, the position of which in the animal kingdom is still
  doubtful. The name Mesozoa was given to the group by its discoverer, E. van Beneden,<a
  id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> as he concluded that they were intermediate
  between the Protozoa and the higher Invertebrates. Recent authors, however, have called attention
  to the resemblance existing between them and the "sporocysts" of Trematodes, and though we still
  are ignorant of certain important points in their life-histories, the Mesozoa are most
  conveniently (and probably rightly) considered as an appendix to the Platyhelminthes.</p>

  <p><b>Dicyemidae.</b>&mdash;If the kidney of <i>Eledone moschata</i>, a Cephalopod common on our
  south-western shores, be opened, a number of fine, yellowish, hair-like filaments may be seen
  attached at one end to its inner surface, floating in the fluid contained in the renal cavity.
  These may be <i>Dicyemennea eledones</i> Wag., although another form, <i>Dicyema moschatum</i>
  Whit., also occurs in the same host. <i>D. eledones</i> (Fig. 46) is 7 to 9 mm. long, transparent,
  and is composed of one large inner cell with a simple nucleus (Fig. 46, <i>n.end</i>), and of an
  outer layer of ciliated cells, nine of which form the "calotte" or pole by which the animal is
  attached. Within the former (endodermal) cell the formation of urn-shaped "infusoriform embryos"
  takes place (B and C), the fate of which is not known, but they are possibly the males. The
  individual which produces these larvae is called a <span class="pagenum" id="page94"><span
  class="smaller">{94}</span></span>"Rhombogen." Other individuals which produce a more elongated
  larva ("vermiform larva," Fig. 45) are called "Nematogens," and Whitman has described a third
  kind, which produce first infusoriform, and then vermiform, larvae (Secondary Nematogens).<a

  <p><b>Orthonectida.</b><a id="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>&mdash;Two species of
  Orthonectids are fairly well known, <i>Rhopalura giardii</i> Metschn. from <i>Amphiura
  squamata</i>, and <i>R. intoshii</i> Metschn. from <i>Nemertes lacteus</i>. The latter appears to
  be very rare, the former occurring in 2 to 5 per cent of the number of hosts examined. The
  parasites occur in a granular "plasmodium," the nature of which is uncertain. Metschnikoff regards
  it as formed by the Orthonectids, and he considers that the cellular envelope, by which it is
  sometimes enclosed, is developed from the neighbouring tissue of the host. These granular,
  sometimes nucleated, plasmodial masses, which can perform active amoeboid movements in sea-water,
  occur attached to the ventral part of the body-cavity of <i>Amphiura</i>, and between the
  gut-branches and body-wall in <i>Nemertes</i>. Should these hosts be infected by great numbers of
  the Orthonectids, their sexual organs degenerate (as is the case with pond-snails attacked by
  sporocysts<a id="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a>), and it is possible that the
  remains of these organs may constitute the "plasmodia" (Braun).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page95"><span class="smaller">{95}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Rhopalura giardii</i> is of distinct sexes. Either males or females are found in one
  <i>Amphiura</i>. Two kinds of females, flattened unsegmented, and cylindrical segmented forms, are
  known. They consist of a ciliated ectodermal layer enclosing an endodermal mass of eggs, between
  which is a fibrillar layer usually considered to be of a muscular nature. The cylindrical female
  gives rise to eggs which develop, probably exclusively, into males. The flattened female produces
  eggs from which females alone arise, though the origin of the two forms of this sex is not well
  ascertained. The males contain spermatozoa which fertilise the eggs of the cylindrical female,
  whereas the ova of the flat form probably develop parthenogenetically.</p>

  <p>The Nemertinea form a compact group, the affinities of which have not been at present clearly
  determined. Several species were mentioned and described in the works of various naturalists
  during the latter half of the eighteenth century, though their anatomy was not understood until
  considerably later. The first mention of any member of the group was made by the Rev. W. Borlase
  in his <i>Natural History of Cornwall</i>, published in 1758. He gives a short description and a
  rough figure of <i>Lineus marinus</i>. From that time the increase in the knowledge of the group
  was very gradual. New species were from time to time described, but few of the descriptions could
  boast of much completeness, and many erroneous views were held until comparatively recent years.
  The group was very variously classified, but the general arrangement in early times seems to have
  been to unite it with the Planarians. Valuable contributions to the history of the development
  were made in 1848 and the few subsequent years by Desor,<a id="NtA_118"

  <p>Nemertines for the most part closely resemble one another in all essential points, though they
  differ considerably in size, colour, and external details. They vary in length from less than an
  inch to thirty yards, this extreme size being attained by <i>Lineus marinus</i>.</p>

  <p>Nemertines are common on the British coasts; about forty species have been recorded from this
  area. On turning over a stone on a sandy or muddy shore in a pool left by the receding tide, there
  may often be seen a coiled mass, having the appearance of a uniform  slimy string  twisted into a
  complicated knot.  If it be carefully removed,  the ends can generally be  made out, one bluntly
  rounded and the other  slightly tapering (Fig. 48, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>). Occasionally there may
  be seen attached to the blunter end a fine thread, which moves about freely. This thread may, by
  an instantaneous movement, be drawn into the body, no trace of its existence being left except at
  the tip of the head, where a small pore is visible; this is the orifice through which it was
  withdrawn. Shortly afterwards the thread may be again shot out, the process being instantaneous
  and often accomplished with <span class="pagenum" id="page101"><span
  class="smaller">{101}</span></span>great force.  This thread (Fig. 50, <i>p</i>) is the proboscis,
  a very important and characteristic organ in Nemertines.</p>

  <p>Most Nemertines are marine; they are mostly indifferent to climate and to the nature of the
  soil on which they live.</p>

  <p>A few forms live on land (e.g. <i>Tetrastemma agricola</i>,<a id="NtA_124"
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> <i>Geonemertes palaensis</i>,<a id="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> and <i>G. chalicophora</i><a id="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>) or in fresh water (e.g. <i>Tetrastemma aquarum dulcium</i><a
  id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> and <i>T. lacustre</i><a id="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a>) in various parts of the globe. There are also parasitic
  forms; the best known of which is <i>Malacobdella</i>.<a id="NtA_129"
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> A pelagic form, <i>Pelagonemertes</i>,<a id="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> has been described by Moseley.</p>

  <p><b>External Characters.</b>&mdash;A typical Nemertine possesses an elongated worm-like body
  (Fig. 49), which is usually thrown into numerous close coils (Fig. 48). In section it may be
  either round or more or less flattened, with the lateral edges in some cases quite thin and almost
  fin-like. One or two broad, flattened, and leaf-shaped forms are known, but such a condition is
  exceptional, and the forms in which it occurs have probably assumed it owing to the adoption of
  special modes of life.</p>

  <p>In the ordinary forms the posterior end of the body is pointed either bluntly or sharply. The
  head is somewhat broader than the rest of the body, and often assumes a spatulate form. Eyes (Fig.
  51, <i>e</i>) are usually present either in one or several pairs, or in symmetrically-arranged
  groups on each side of the head. The mouth (Fig. 58, <i>m</i>) is situated near the front end of
  the body on the ventral surface, and is usually rendered conspicuous by being surrounded by thick
  tumid lips. It varies in form from being slit-like to elliptical. At the anterior end of the body
  a <span class="pagenum" id="page102"><span class="smaller">{102}</span></span>small terminal pore
  occurs; this is the external opening of the proboscis (Fig. 51, <i>p.p</i>).</p>

  <p>Nemertines are often very diversely and brilliantly coloured, the hues most commonly found
  being white, yellow, green, deep purple, and various shades of red and pink. The ventral surface
  is usually paler in colour than the dorsal, and the latter is often marked by longitudinal and
  transverse stripes (Fig. 59) in contrasting colours.</p>

  <p>The whole animal is enveloped in a layer of mucus, which sometimes becomes hardened to form a
  tube, and this may be still further strengthened by an admixture of particles of sand or
  earth.</p>

  <p>The body is capable to a great extent of contraction and extension, a Nemertine many inches
  long being apt, when irritated or alarmed, to contract itself to the length of not more than half
  an inch. Hence, unless the animal is kept and carefully watched, a very erroneous idea may be
  conceived as to its size.</p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The body-wall consists of several layers (Fig. 52), which in a typical
  highly-developed Nemertine are as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. An external epidermic layer (<i>ep</i>), consisting of ciliated cells, among which are
  placed numerous unicellular glands.  These glands probably secrete the mucus in which the
  Nemertine is usually enveloped; their contents when in the body are very highly refracting. The
  epidermis rests on a basement membrane (<i>b.m</i>).</p>

  <p>2. The two or three muscular layers, arranged as either an external circular and an internal
  longitudinal, or an inner and an outer circular separated by a longitudinal layer, or, as in the

  <p><b>The Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The mouth is placed on the ventral surface near the anterior
  end of the body (Figs. 53, 58, <i>m</i>). It leads into a straight oesophagus (Fig. 53,
  <i>oes</i>), whence passes off the intestine (<i>int</i>), which is continued as a straight
  non-convoluted tube to the anus (<i>a</i>), situated terminally at the posterior end of the body.
  The intestine is thrown out throughout the greater part of its course into paired lateral
  pouches.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is lined throughout by a ciliated epithelium. The oesophagus has, in
  addition to this layer, an outer thick coat of large granular cells, which probably have a
  glandular function.</p>

  <p><b>Proboscis.</b>&mdash;The most characteristic organ of the Nemertines is the proboscis (Figs.
  50, 53, 54). For many years its disposition and function were misunderstood, and it was supposed
  to be a portion of the digestive system. The proboscis, which lies dorsal to the alimentary canal,
  opens at the extreme anterior end of the body by a small pore (Figs. 51, 53, 58). When retracted
  it is sometimes considerably folded, and lies in a long pouch or sheath. To the walls of this
  sheath it is attached round its anterior <span class="pagenum" id="page104"><span
  class="smaller">{104}</span></span>end; and strong muscles unite its posterior extremity to the
  sheath a short distance from the posterior end of the latter.</p>

  <p>The proboscis seems to be exclusively a tactile and protective and defensive organ, for which
  functions it is eminently fitted by the great ease and rapidity with which it is everted or thrust
  out from the body. It consists of two distinct regions (Fig. 54, <i>g.p</i> and <i>m.p</i>). In
  the retracted state the anterior part is a hollow tube with very thick muscular walls made up of
  several layers. At the base of this part in many of the Nemertines there is situated a
  sharp-pointed spine projecting forward into the lumen, and several smaller stylets situated in a
  pair of vesicles close to the base of the central spine. The position of the spines in the everted
  proboscis is shown in Fig. 57. The posterior part of the proboscis is also a tube, but instead of
  being muscular, its walls are glandular. This posterior glandular part is never everted.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The eversion is effected by a turning inside out of the anterior part of the proboscis (Fig.
  54). The process whereby the proboscis is retracted has been very aptly compared to the effect
  which would be produced by the inversion of the finger of a glove, accomplished by pulling a
  string attached to its tip on the inside, the anterior muscular part being comparable to the
  finger and the glandular part to the string. It is thus obvious that in the everted condition the
  stylet will form the anterior tip of the <span class="pagenum" id="page105"><span
  class="smaller">{105}</span></span>proboscis, and will there be in a position for offence or
  defence (Fig. 57, <i>s</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b><a id="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>&mdash;The brain is
  composed of two ganglionic masses (Fig. 53, <i>n.g</i>) lying at the anterior end of the body, one
  on each side of the proboscis, and united by commissures passing round it (Fig. 55, <i>d.c</i> and
  <i>v.c</i>). Each ganglionic mass is often partially divided into a dorsal and ventral lobe
  (<i>n.g.d</i> and <i>n.g.v</i>). From the brain a pair of cords pass off backwards along the sides
  of the body (<i>n.c</i>); these cords, which have no ganglionic swellings, in some forms unite
  with one another above the anus. Anteriorly nerves are given off from the brain to the eyes and
  front part of the head (<i>a.n</i>). A nerve to the proboscis is given off from the commissure
  which unites the two halves of the brain dorsal to the proboscis (<i>d.n</i>).</p>

  </div>

  <p>In two out of the three groups into which the Nemertines are divided, the lateral nerve-cords
  are in connexion with a network or plexus of nerves lying between the muscular layers of the
  body-wall (Fig. 52, <i>n.l</i>), and in some forms constituting a comparatively thick layer. In
  these two groups there are no definite <span class="pagenum" id="page106"><span
  class="smaller">{106}</span></span>nerve branches except the anterior ones to the head. In the
  third group of Nemertines the lateral nerve-cords lie within the muscular layers of the body-wall,
  and in this case paired nerve branches are given off at definite intervals throughout the whole
  length of the body. These branches divide up among the organs to which they pass, and no nerve
  plexus is present.</p>

  <p>The lateral cords vary in position in different cases. Sometimes they lie laterally, at others
  the cords tend to approximate to one another in the median dorsal or in the median ventral line,
  though in every case they remain distinctly separated.</p>

  <p><b>Sense Organs.</b>&mdash;Sense organs are usually present in the form of eyes arranged at the
  sides of the head (Fig. 51, <i>e</i>), sometimes as a single pair and sometimes in one or more
  groups on each side. The structure of the eyes varies from a simple pigment spot to an organ which
  receives a special nerve-supply from the brain, and possesses a refracting body answering to a
  lens, and behind this a pigment layer and a layer of rods. Some forms are devoid of all traces of
  eyes.</p>

  <p>A pair of simple auditory capsules has been found in some of the <i>Hoplonemertea</i>, where
  they occur as small vesicles on the brain.</p>

  <p>The whole surface of the body appears to be remarkably sensitive. In a few forms small tufts of
  tactile hairs are said to be present in the region of the head, while in others there <span
  class="pagenum" id="page107"><span class="smaller">{107}</span></span>are a few long hairs
  scattered sparsely among the cilia of the epidermis.</p>

  <p><i>Frontal Organ.</i>&mdash;In many Nemertines there is present at the anterior tip of the head
  a disc-shaped group of cells bearing long hairs or bristles. On this disc open the secreting ducts
  of a number of gland cells lying in the head. It seems possible that this frontal organ may
  function as an organ of taste.</p>

  <p><i>Side Organs.</i>&mdash;In the Carinellidae there is a pair of circular epithelial patches
  lying one on each side of the body in the region of the excretory pore. The cells composing them
  are richly ciliated and provided with a plentiful nerve-supply. The function of these epithelial
  patches is not known, but it has been suggested that they may be auditory organs.</p>

  <p><i>Cephalic Slits and Cerebral Organs.</i>&mdash;In most Nemertines there is a peculiar pair of
  organs (Figs. 50, 53, <i>c.s</i>), situated in the head and in close connexion with the brain. The
  function of these organs is not known. Hubrecht has suggested that they may be respiratory, while
  B&uuml;rger<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> conjectures that they may be organs
  which are used for discriminating the condition of the surrounding medium. In an external
  examination of the head, the cephalic slits may usually be seen as a pair of lateral furrows or
  pits. Their form and direction vary considerably; they may take the form of shallow circular
  depressions, or they may lie longitudinally and be slit-like in shape (Fig. 50), or the slit may
  lie at right angles to the long axis of the body and be beset with short transverse furrows. In
  some forms these slits are merely superficial depressions, but in others they are continued into
  ciliated ducts, which pass inwards and penetrate into special lobes, consisting of glandular
  tissue and ganglion cells, in close connexion with the brain. These lobes are called the cerebral
  organs.</p>

  <p>In many forms the nervous system is charged with haemoglobin, which gives to it a bright red
  colour.</p>

  <p><b>Circulatory or Blood-Vascular System.</b>&mdash;The circulatory system consists of three
  main longitudinal vessels, a median dorsal and a pair of lateral ones. These are connected
  together posteriorly by a transverse trunk, and also throughout the whole length of their course
  by branches, which are given off at regular intervals. Anteriorly the three longitudinal vessels
  <span class="pagenum" id="page108"><span class="smaller">{108}</span></span>either all unite and
  form a collar (Fig. 55, <i>v.s</i>) round the oesophagus, or they break up into a number of
  lacunar or open spaces in free communication with one another.</p>

  <p>The blood is usually colourless, but in some cases the corpuscles are coloured red by
  haemoglobin.</p>

  found in <i>Tetrastemma obscurum</i>, on the outer side of, but near to the lateral blood-vessels,
  a pair of canals. He observed ciliary movements in the canals, but could not discover flame cells.
  Further contributions to our knowledge of the excretory system were made by Semper,<a id="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> von Kennel,<a id="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>
  Hubrecht,<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> and Oudemans.<a id="NtA_137"
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> The latter states that the excretory system consists of a pair
  of canals situated laterally near the anterior end of the body. Each canal communicates with the
  exterior by one or more ducts having lateral regularly-arranged apertures. In some cases he was
  unable to make out any communication with the vascular system, but in others <span class="pagenum"
  id="page109"><span class="smaller">{109}</span></span>a direct communication, by means of open
  connexions with the lacunar blood spaces, is said to occur.</p>

  <p>Silliman<a id="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> in <i>Tetrastemma aquarum
  dulcium</i> describes the excretory vessels as ending in numerous capillary branches, at the blind
  terminations of which cilia are present. He states that there is no important difference between
  the excretory systems of Rhabdocoeles and Nemertines.</p>

  <p>B&uuml;rger,<a id="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> as the result of recent
  investigations on the excretory system in Nemertines, finds that the minute branches end in
  flame-cells (Fig. 56, B) lying on and among the blood-vessels, but having no open connexion with
  them.</p>

  <p><b>Generative System.</b>&mdash;The Nemertines are for the most part dioecious, only a few
  certainly hermaphrodite species having been described, e.g. <i>Tetrastemma</i> ("<i>Borlasia</i>")
  <i>kefersteinii</i> Mar.<a id="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The generative products in both cases are contained in sacs (Figs. 52, 53, <i>g</i>) which lie
  in the lateral region of the body between the pouches of the alimentary canal. The ova and
  spermatozoa are conveyed to the exterior by short ducts. Most species are oviparous, though a few
  viviparous species are known (e.g. <i>Prosorhochmus claparedii</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;Nemertines were divided by M. Schultze<a id="NtA_141"
  href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> into<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Enopla</i>, in which the proboscis is armed with stylets.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Anopla</i>, in which the proboscis is unarmed.</p>

  <p>Although this classification was fairly correct as far as it went, since many other distinctive
  features were correlated with the presence or absence of armature in the proboscis, still there
  are several primitive forms belonging to the <i>Anopla</i>, which possess characters such as
  render it necessary to class them together in a separate group.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For this reason Hubrecht divided the Nemertinea into three
  Orders&mdash;<i>Hoplonemertea</i>, <i>Schizonemertea</i>, <i>Palaeonemertea</i>; the first of
  these Orders corresponding with the <i>Enopla</i>, and the other two with the <i>Anopla</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page110"><span class="smaller">{110}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Hoplonemertea.</b></p>

  <p>The proboscis is armed. The epidermis rests on a thick layer of connective tissue plentifully
  supplied with glands, below which is a prominent basement membrane. The muscular layers of the
  body are two in number, an outer circular and an inner longitudinal. The nerve-trunks lie within
  the muscular layers of the body and give off regularly-arranged branches. There is no nerve
  plexus. Each of the cephalic slits generally opens by a pore situated in the centre of a
  transverse groove, which is beset along one side by a row of shorter grooves at right angles to
  it. The apparatus consists of a ciliated duct surrounded by nerve tissue, and passing into lobes
  of tissue which are connected with the brain by thick nerve-cords. The mouth opens rather far
  forward in front of the brain. The intestinal pouches are symmetrically arranged. Auditory organs
  are said to exist in some forms, consisting of vesicles containing otoliths. The vascular trunks
  are connected anteriorly by closed vessels and not by lacunar spaces.</p>

  <p>The proboscis is unarmed. The epidermis is separated from the layer of connective tissue by a
  thin basement membrane, hence the glands in the connective tissue are more deeply situated and
  have long ducts. The muscular layers are three in number, an outer and an inner longitudinal layer

  From each groove a canal passes inwards into a posterior brain-lobe. The mouth opens behind the

  <p>A most important monograph by B&uuml;rger<a id="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> on
  Nemertines has just been published, but unfortunately it appeared too late to be adequately
  considered here. He gives an elaborate account, illustrated by admirable figures, of the present
  state of our knowledge of this group, and his work will be indispensable to future students of the
  subject. The older systems of classification are criticised, and the following scheme is adopted
  in their place<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order I. Protonemertini</span> (= part of the Palaeonemertea, e.g.
  <i>Carinella</i>).&mdash;The brain and lateral nerve-cords lie outside the muscle layers in the
  epithelium or below the basement membrane. The body-wall consists of the following layers:
  epidermis, basement membrane, circular muscles, and longitudinal muscles. The mouth lies behind
  the brain. The proboscis is unarmed.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order II. Mesonemertini</span> (= part of the Palaeonemertea, e.g.

  nerve-cords lie in the parenchyma of the body internal to the muscle layers. The layers of the
  body-wall are <span class="pagenum" id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>similar
  to those of the Protonemertini. The mouth lies in front of the brain. The proboscis is armed. At
  the junction of the fore- and mid-gut a diverticulum is given off which projects forwards beneath
  the fore-gut and ends blindly in front.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order IV. Heteronemertini</span> (= Schizonemertea, and the genera
  <i>Eupolia</i> and <i>Valencinia</i>, placed provisionally by Hubrecht in the
  Palaeonemertea).&mdash;The body-wall consists of the following layers: epidermis, thick cutis, and
  an outer and an inner longitudinal muscle layer separated from one another by a circular muscle
  layer. The brain and lateral nerve-cords lie between the outer longitudinal and the circular
  muscle layers. The mouth lies behind the brain. The proboscis is unarmed.</p>

  <p><b>Development of the Nemertinea.</b>&mdash;The development of the Palaeonemertea is at present
  not known: in the Schizonemertea a larval stage occurs; while in the Hoplonemertea the egg
  develops directly without undergoing any metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>There are two forms of larva characteristic of the Schizonemertea, known respectively as
  Pilidium and the Type of Desor. The Pilidium is hatched early and leads a free-swimming existence,
  whereas the Type of Desor, though in many respects resembling it, never passes through the
  free-swimming phase.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Pilidium (Fig. 60) is a helmet-shaped larva bearing a tuft or spike dorsally, and prolonged
  downwards laterally into a pair of lobes. The whole larva is covered with cilia, there being a
  specially strong band round its ventral surface. The dorsal spike is composed of a bunch of
  strongly developed cilia or of a long flagellum. The alimentary canal consists of a sac
  constricted into <span class="pagenum" id="page114"><span
  class="smaller">{114}</span></span>oesophageal and gastric regions (Fig. 60, <i>oes</i> and
  <i>st</i>). In this condition the larva swims about freely in the water. The helmet-shaped
  Pilidium-skin forms no part of the future Nemertine, the skin of which is developed as ingrowths
  from it; these meet one another and unite to form a complete covering round the alimentary canal;
  the larval skin is then cast off, and by a series of gradual steps the embryo develops into the
  adult.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Nemertines are often found under stones between high- and low-water marks,
  lying on sandy or muddy bottoms. They are usually in the form of coiled masses, and are generally
  in a state of quiescence. Hence it is probable that their period of activity is during high-water,
  and that when left by the receding tide they subside into a resting condition.</p>

  <p>The large kinds, such as <i>Lineus marinus</i>, seem to be always found living alone, but some
  of the smaller kinds, notably <i>Tetrastemma dorsale</i> and <i>Prosorhochmus claparedii</i>, have
  gregarious habits and live in masses, the coils of the different individuals being inextricably
  mixed.</p>

  <p>Some species, such as <i>Micrura purpurea</i>, <i>Amphiporus pulcher</i>, and <i>Cerebratulus
  angulatus</i>, frequent empty bivalve shells, while Nemertines are often found in empty limpet
  shells adhering to rocks in tidal pools. Other smaller forms resort to no such definite
  protection, but live among seaweeds; some of these remain naked, while others secrete for
  themselves tubes of a membranous or gelatinous consistency. <i>Borlasia elizabethae</i> lives in a
  burrow of clay.</p>

  <p>Nemertines are commonly dredged from a depth of six or eight fathoms. They may sometimes be
  found floating on the surface of the water, and some possess the power of swimming rapidly,
  propelling themselves by a lateral motion of the tail, the sides of which are in such cases
  prolonged into a thin fin-like edge. This mode of progression is usually adopted by those which
  frequent deep water. A pelagic Nemertine (<i>Pelagonemertes</i>) was discovered by Moseley near
  the southern verge of the South Australian current, being found in a trawl with deep-sea forms
  from a depth of 1800 fathoms. This animal was leaf-like in shape, bluntly pointed behind and
  rather square in front.</p>

  <p>The power possessed by Nemertines of secreting mucus is very great, their course being often
  traceable by the tracks which they leave behind them. Many of them glide along with great
  rapidity, a mode of progression which is probably due to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115"><span class="smaller">{115}</span></span>cilia covering the whole outer skin, and to
  the extreme contractility of the muscles of the body-wall. In some locomotion is effected by the
  proboscis; this is protruded and attaches itself by means of its spines to some foreign body,
  after which the body is drawn up after it. This has been specially observed in a land form,
  <i>Tetrastemma agricola</i>, discovered by Willemoes-Suhm in the Bermudas. On solid bodies the
  movement is a kind of crawling action, the head and mouth acting as suckers in much the same way
  as in many Leeches.</p>

  <p>Most Nemertines can be very readily kept in confinement. The chief apparent effect of such a
  life is a loss of colour, the animal gradually becoming pallid in hue. Owing also to the absence
  of proper food they diminish very much in size, though even when all food is kept away an animal
  will sometimes continue to live as long as eighteen months.</p>

  <p><b>Food.</b>&mdash;Nemertines are carnivorous in their habits and are very voracious, devouring
  any prey which comes in their way, whether it be living or dead. No animal food seems to come
  amiss to them, and they will devour creatures of considerable size. When in contact with its prey,
  the Nemertine dilates its mouth to a large extent, and the anterior end of the oesophagus is
  thrust out and engulfs the animal. Chaetopods form a favourite food material, the whole animal
  being swallowed quite regardless of the hard chitinous bristles and spines with which it is beset.
  The soft parts are gradually digested, the bristles and other indigestible portions being extruded
  by the anus. The larger spines often pass out by perforating passages through the wall of the
  intestine and through the body-wall. The aperture thus formed appears speedily to heal after the
  foreign body has been extruded.</p>

  <p>The carnivorous habits of Nemertines even extend to cannibalism, and when kept in confinement
  they frequently devour one another. For this reason it is unsafe to keep large and small kinds
  together, as the small ones speedily disappear, being used as food material by the large. If one
  be divided into several pieces, the pieces are very rapidly demolished by other individuals.</p>

  <p><b>Regeneration.</b><a id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>&mdash;This power is, no
  doubt, of great service to these animals, since injury, or even violent local irritation, often
  causes complete rupture at the point affected. It seems that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>chief power of regeneration is situated in
  the head, as, if a very short piece be broken off the anterior end of the body, it very rapidly
  reproduces itself into a new individual. The hind end of the original body often lives for a
  considerable time, but it does not in most cases appear to possess the power of reproducing a
  head, and after existing for a time it dies. For a while, however, it so far retains its vital
  powers that the generative products continue to grow, and actually attain to perfection. Severe
  wounds also heal very quickly and completely, and all local injuries are speedily repaired.</p>

  <p>Owing to the force with which it is shot out, the proboscis is often completely severed from
  the body, and in such a case the animal grows a new one in an extremely short space of time. The
  proboscis thus broken off retains its power of movement and contractility for a considerable time,
  and has been more than once mistaken for a worm. This great vital power is probably due to the
  great development of nervous tissue, the proboscis being usually richly supplied with nerve
  plexuses.</p>

  <p>One large form, <i>Lineus sanguineus</i>, seems to possess great recuperative powers. It shows
  a marked tendency to break up into pieces, when not only the head end, but also the other portions
  develop into perfect animals, each one growing a head and all the organs belonging to it. Thus in
  this case an animal may multiply by a simple process of transverse fission, and form numerous
  complete individuals.</p>

  <p><b>Breeding.</b>&mdash;The breeding season only appears to cease in the extreme of winter.
  Different genera and species seem to mature their generative products at different times.</p>

  <p>In the armed Nemertines the eggs are deposited separately, and are not connected together
  except by such accidental mucus as the animal deposits normally; but in the unarmed a special
  mucous secretion forms a thick investment for the eggs.</p>

  <p>M&lsquo;Intosh<a id="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> has observed the process of
  the deposition of the male and female products in <i>Nemertes gracilis</i>. He put into a glass
  vessel a male and female of this species in which the products were apparently ripe. Soon
  spermatozoa began to issue in wreath-like jets from the body of the male, at first from the middle
  region of the body, and afterwards anteriorly and posteriorly, until the animal was enveloped in a
  dense cloud of <span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span
  class="smaller">{117}</span></span>spermatozoa. The whole process only lasted a few minutes. When
  all the spermatozoa had apparently been given out, the female was seen to protrude her head from
  the sand; she then passed to the side of the vessel and deposited a group of eggs about three
  inches distant from the spermatozoa.</p>

  <p>With only a few exceptions Nemertines are oviparous. <i>Prosorhochmus claparedii</i>,
  <i>Tetrastemma obscurum</i>, and <i>Monopora vivipara</i> have been observed to contain embryos at
  certain times of the year. In other forms the eggs are laid when ripe, and development takes place
  subsequently to their deposition.</p>

  <p><b>Geographical Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nemertines have been found in all seas from the arctic
  to the equatorial regions. Many forms are found in the British Isles both between tide-marks and
  also at greater depths around our coasts. Some genera seem to be confined to warm climates and
  others to cold; while others appear to be indifferent to climate, and to subsist equally well
  under very various degrees of temperature. So far as is known, the land forms are all indigenous
  to warm countries.</p>

  <p><b>Land Forms.</b>&mdash;Land forms, which occur on or in moist earth under stones or decaying
  vegetable matter, have been discovered and described by Semper,<a id="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> Willemoes-Suhm,<a href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> and von
  Graff.<a href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The species found by Semper, and called by him <i>Geonemertes palaensis</i>, lives under damp
  leaves and the roots of trees on Pelew Island in the North Pacific. It is about 2 inches long, of
  a reddish-white colour, with narrow, brownish-black, longitudinal stripes on its dorsal surface.
  It possesses six eyes and very small cephalic slits and cerebral organs. The proboscis is armed,
  and opens by the mouth instead of by a special pore.</p>

  <p>The same peculiarity as to the opening of the proboscis is found in <i>Geonemertes
  chalicophora</i>, discovered by von Graff in pots of <i>Corypha australis</i> in the palm-house at
  Frankfurt-on-Main. He found specimens on and beneath the surface of the earth. As it was only
  found in pots in which this Australian plant was growing, von Graff thought it almost certain that
  it was a native of Australia. Those found below the surface of the earth were surrounded by a
  transparent tube in which particles of earth were embedded. The animal is small, only about
  two-fifths of an inch in length. The colour is milk-white, with a small quantity of red pigment
  anteriorly: there are four eyes, and the cephalic slits are absent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page118"><span class="smaller">{118}</span></span></div>

  <p>The species which was discovered by Willemoes-Suhm, and named by him <i>Tetrastemma
  agricola</i>, lives under stones in damp earth in the Bermudas. It differs from the other two in
  that the proboscis opens by a special terminal aperture. It measures nearly an inch and a half in
  length, and, like <i>G. chalicophora</i>, is milk-white in colour. It resembles it also in
  possessing four eyes, and in the absence of cerebral organs and cephalic slits.</p>

  <p><b>Fresh-water Forms.</b>&mdash;In most cases the descriptions of fresh-water forms are so
  vague and incomplete that it is difficult to determine whether or not they are different
  species.</p>

  <p>They are probably more numerous than is at present known, and are certainly scattered widely
  over the face of the earth, since they have been found in Nicaragua, at Tashkend in Turkestan, and
  at Philadelphia and Monroe in the United States.</p>

  <p>A form of which we have a full description is <i>Tetrastemma aquarum dulcium</i>, found by
  Silliman<a id="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> at Monroe, under stones in brooks in
  company with Planarians. It is a small worm of a red or pink colour, about half an inch in length,
  and it possesses usually three pairs of eyes. The proboscis is armed, and opens by a separate
  aperture. The excretory system consists of a vessel on each side of the body, each opening
  externally by a pore, and internally dividing into numerous branches which end in ciliated
  expansions. An individual of the same species was found by Beddard in one of the tanks in the
  Botanical Gardens in Regent's Park, but as the tank is one in which tropical plants are grown, it
  had almost certainly been introduced among the roots of the plants, and cannot be considered as a
  British species.</p>

  <p>A fresh-water Nemertine belonging to the genus <i>Tetrastemma</i> was, however, found by
  Benham<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> on the roots of some water plants in the
  Cherwell at Oxford. The specimen was of a bright orange colour and measured half an inch in
  length.</p>

  <p>Du Plessis<a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> found another fresh-water form on
  the lower surface of stones in shallow pools on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, and named it
  <i>Tetrastemma lacustre</i>. It is a small animal, the largest specimens being rather over an inch
  in length.</p>

  <p>Another European genus was found in 1893 by F. E. Schulze in Berlin. It has been fully
  described by T. H. Montgomery,<a id="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> who has given it
  the name of <i>Stichostemma eilhardii</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page119"><span class="smaller">{119}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Parasitic Forms.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Malacobdella</i> was found by von Kennel<a
  id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> in large numbers living on <i>Cyprina
  islandica</i>, a Lamellibranch Mollusc, in the harbour at Kiel; and it has also been described by
  Riches<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> as a British form. It is attached to its
  host by means of a large round sucker situated at the posterior end of the ventral surface, while
  the rest of the body waves about freely in the mantle-cavity. It is perhaps hardly correct to
  describe this animal as parasitic, since it does not appear to obtain its nutriment at the expense
  of the host by preying on its juices. The advantage of its position is, however, obvious, since a
  perpetual current of water is kept up in the mantle-cavity of the Mollusc, and from the stream the
  Nemertine is able to pick out and take for itself any food material which it considers suitable.
  At the same time it is not subjected to the influence of the winds and waves, as the shell of the
  mollusc acts as a barrier to prevent the entrance of disturbing elements.</p>

  <p><i>Malacobdella</i> is short and broad, somewhat flattened dorso-ventrally. The anterior end is
  bluntly rounded. The mouth opens into a wide pharynx, which is constricted behind and then passes
  into the intestine; this after a few coils opens by the anus situated dorsally immediately above
  the sucker. The proboscis opens into the pharynx.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Palaeontology.</b>&mdash;Nemertines are unknown in a fossil state; this is probably owing to
  the softness of their bodies, which would render their preservation extremely improbable.</p>

  <p><b>Affinities.</b>&mdash;Until recently the Nemertines were regarded as a sub-order of the
  Turbellaria. They were afterwards separated from the Turbellaria and placed as a distinct class of
  the phylum Platyhelminthes.</p>

  <p>Some zoologists have considered them to be so different in many respects from the other classes
  of the Platyhelminthes as to justify their being altogether separated from that phylum, and
  treated as a distinct group.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page120"><span class="smaller">{120}</span></span></div>

  <p>If, however, the recent work of B&uuml;rger on the excretory system is to be relied upon, the
  existence of flame cells would be a strong reason for classing them among the Platyhelminthes.</p>

  <p>Hubrecht<a id="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> has instituted an interesting
  comparison between Nemertines and Vertebrates. He compares the median dorsal nerve of Nemertines
  to the spinal cord of Vertebrates; the lateral nerve-cords to the nerve of the Vertebrate lateral
  line; and the lateral swellings which constitute the brain in Nemertines to the lateral ganglia of
  the cephalic region in Vertebrates. This view is strengthened by the existence of transverse
  nerves connecting the lateral and dorsal nerves of Nemertines, since these may be compared with
  the spinal nerves of Vertebrates. He suggests that both Nemertines and Vertebrates may have arisen
  from a vermiform animal possessing a nervous layer in the form of a plexus of nerve-fibres, the
  nerve tissue having become concentrated along three lines to form a median dorsal and two lateral
  nerve trunks; the former being specially developed in the Vertebrata and the latter in the
  Nemertines. Hubrecht further suggests that the notochord of Vertebrates may be a survival of the
  proboscis sheath of Nemertines, while the proboscis of the latter may be represented by the
  invagination to form the pituitary body in Vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Certain authors<a id="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> have suggested that
  indications exist of a relationship between Nemertines and <i>Balanoglossus</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The features which are supposed to indicate this are the elongated vermiform shape
  showing no external signs of segmentation; the ciliated smooth skin and the possession of
  unicellular mucous glands; and the protrusible proboscis, which may be comparable to the
  non-retractile proboscis of <i>Balanoglossus</i>, a comparison which is strengthened by the fact
  that in some Nemertines a sheath of nerve-fibres exists in the wall of the proboscis corresponding
  to the nerve plexus in the proboscis of <i>Balanoglossus</i>. In both cases an ectodermic nerve
  plexus exists with local thickenings along definite lines, although these lines are not the same
  in the two cases. Both possess a straight alimentary canal, ending in a terminal anus and thrown
  out into paired lateral caeca, between which are the paired metamerically-arranged generative
  sacs.</p>

  <p>The Nemathelminthes include three sub-Orders of very different size and importance.  These
  are&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p style="margin-left:0.70em">i. The Nematoda.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:0.35em">ii. The Nematomorpha (Gordiidae).</p>
    <p>iii. The Acanthocephala.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Although the members of these groups differ considerably from one another, on the whole there
  is a closer resemblance between them than between any one of them and any other group of animals,
  and there is a certain convenience in arranging them under one head.</p>

  <p>The following characteristics are common to all three groups of the Nemathelminthes: they are
  worm-like in form, and with few exceptions are parasitic in the bodies of other animals, either
  Vertebrate or Invertebrate. Some of them spend their whole existence within the bodies of their
  hosts, but more commonly they are only parasitic during a certain period of their life; a few,
  however, lead a free life in water or in damp earth. None of the Nemathelminthes are
  segmented&mdash;that is, their bodies are not divided into a number of parts which serially repeat
  each other, and which resemble more or less closely the preceding and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page124"><span class="smaller">{124}</span></span>succeeding parts. They are not provided with
  any appendages or limbs, but sometimes bear a few bristles or hooks, and in rarer cases suckers.
  The body, which is elongated and, as a rule, thread-like and tapering at each end, is enclosed in
  a thick cuticle or hardened secretion of the underlying cells. In no Nemathelminth is there any
  closed vascular system, nor are special respiratory organs developed.</p>

  <p>In many respects the most remarkable peculiarity of these animals is that, with the possible
  exception of the excretory organs of the Acanthocephala, there is a complete absence of cilia
  throughout the whole group. In this respect they resemble the Arthropoda. The universal presence
  of these small flickering processes of cells from man down to the simplest unicellular organisms
  makes the absence of these structures most remarkable. In many animals they are the sole organs of
  locomotion, and in almost all they perform very important functions, both in bringing food and
  oxygen to the body, and in removing waste matter from it. At present there seems to be no adequate
  explanation for their absence in the two large groups mentioned above.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Nemathelminthes are, with hardly an exception, dioecious&mdash;that is to say,
  their male and female reproductive organs are in different individuals. Their young do not differ
  markedly from the adults, except in the absence of sexual organs, but the immature stages are
  usually termed larvae, and not infrequently either inhabit a different host from the adult, or are
  free when the adults are parasitic, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order I. Nematoda.</b></p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The Nematode worms, or thread-worms, form by far the largest and most
  important division of the group Nemathelminthes. The number of species is great, and although the
  conditions under which they live are of the most varied kind, there is, as a rule, little
  corresponding difference in structure, and hence the determination of the species is attended with
  no small difficulty.</p>

  <p>With few exceptions the shape of the body is filiform (Figs. 66 and 71), the two ends being
  more or less pointed, and the posterior end of the male, which is generally a smaller animal than
  the female, is usually slightly recurved. The worms are, as a rule, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page125"><span class="smaller">{125}</span></span>white, or of the colour of polished ivory;
  they may be opaque or semi-transparent, but pigment spots are rarely developed.</p>

  <p>Minute Nematodes abound in moist soil, around the roots of plants, etc., and may easily be
  detected with the aid of a lens wriggling about amongst the particles of sand and earth. Of the
  animal parasites perhaps the most familiar is the "round worm" (<i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, Figs.
  66 and 67), which inhabits the alimentary canal of man; others are common in domesticated animals,
  as <i>A. mystax</i> in the cat and dog, and <i>A. megalocephala</i> in the horse and ox. They are
  also found living parasitically in plants (Fig. 77), causing the formation of galls and other
  pathological growths; <i>Anguillula</i> (<i>Tylenchus</i>) <i>tritici</i> causes in this way
  considerable damage to corn, and others attack root-crops, cabbages, etc. The "vinegar eel"
  (<i>Anguillula aceti</i>), which occurs so often in weak vinegar, is another familiar example of
  this group.</p>

  <p><b>The Skin.</b>&mdash;The body of the worm is encased in a relatively thick, transparent,
  smooth cuticle, which is turned in at the various apertures, and lines the tubes connected with
  them for a greater or less distance. The cuticle is in some cases raised to form spikes or hooks,
  and in certain species, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Ascaris mystax</i> and <i>A. transfuga</i>, it is produced
  into two lateral fins, which are supported by a thickened triradiate rod of specialised cuticle
  (Fig. 62); these fins, however, do not run far down the body. As a rule the cuticle is quite
  smooth, but it may be ringed, as in <i>Filaria laticaudata</i> and in <i>F. denticulata</i>; and
  the rings may bear backwardly-projecting teeth.</p>

  <p>The skin of Nematodes consists of three layers&mdash;(i.) the above-mentioned <i>cuticle</i>,
  which is presumably secreted by (ii.) the <i>sub-cuticle</i> or <i>epidermis</i> which underlies
  it; the latter surrounds in its turn (iii.) the <i>muscular layer</i>.</p>

  <p>The nature of the sub-cuticle is one of the debateable points in the morphology of the
  Nematoda. No cell outlines have been detected in it, although nuclei are scattered through it; it
  is in fact a <i>syncytium</i>, or protoplasmic mass in which cell limits cannot be distinguished.
  Many of the cells forming it have broken down into fibrils, and these form a close meshwork, which
  is occasionally specialised, as, for instance, round the nerve-cords. Along the median dorsal and
  ventral lines, and along the lateral lines, this tissue is heaped up in such a way as to divide
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span class="smaller">{126}</span></span>enclosed
  muscle-cells into four quadrants. These thickenings surround dorsally and ventrally a specialised
  nerve-cord, and laterally the excretory canals.</p>

  <p>According to Jammes<a id="NtA_155" href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> this lack of
  differentiation in the sub-cuticular layer is caused by the early appearance of the cuticle, which
  he thinks is necessitated, at any rate in many of the parasitic forms, by the action which the
  digestive juices of the host would have on the otherwise unprotected body-wall.</p>

  <p>The nervous system, according to the same writer, is of the same nature as this sub-cuticular
  tissue, only it is more differentiated, or perhaps we should say it has retained more of the
  primitive cellular character of the embryonic tissue. The fibres of the sub-cuticular tissue are
  closely connected with the fibrils which compose the spongioplasm (Fig. 64, <i>d</i>) of the
  muscles,<a id="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> and form also the sheaths of the
  various nerves; in fact the passage of these fibrils into the nerves is so gradual that it is
  impossible to make any separation between them.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page127"><span class="smaller">{127}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>The Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The central organ of the nervous system is the
  circumoesophageal ring which surrounds the pharynx, close to the anterior end of the body, in
  <i>A. megalocephala</i> 1&frac12; to 2 mm. behind the mouth.<a id="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> Ganglion cells are found in the ring, but they are not
  numerous, and are chiefly aggregated round the points of origin of the nerves.</p>

  <p>Six short nerves, three on each side of the median line, run forward from the ring, a pair of
  these ending in each of the three papillae which surround the mouth.</p>

  <p>Behind, the nerve-ring gives off six main nerve trunks, of which the dorsal and ventral nerves
  are usually the largest. These run in the median dorsal and ventral thickenings of the
  sub-cuticular tissue, and are connected one with another by numerous fine lateral branches running
  through the sub-cuticle.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The lateral nerves, which consist of two or four bundles, one or two lying dorsal and one or
  two ventral to each excretory canal, have a double origin. The dorsal branches arise directly from
  the nerve-ring, and at their point of origin there is a considerable accumulation of ganglion
  cells, from which two commissures on each side run into the ventral nerve (Fig. 63, <i>f</i>). The
  ventral branches arise from the ventral nerve-cord immediately in front of the excretory pore. At
  the posterior end the lateral nerves pass into the two branches into which the ventral nerve
  divides. Just before the point where the ventral <span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span
  class="smaller">{128}</span></span>nerve splits it swells out into an anal ganglion situated just
  in front of the anus. In the male<a id="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> this anal
  ganglion gives off two lateral nerves which pass round the cloaca and form a ring, and in this sex
  the ventro-lateral nerve, which is much strengthened by fibres from the ventral nerve, and has
  received, owing to the mistaken impression that it was a special <i>nervus recurrens</i>, the name
  of the "bursal nerve," gives off numerous branches to the sense papillae which are found in this
  region of the body and on the tail. The arrangement of these parts is shown in Fig. 63.</p>

  <p>Sense organs are but poorly developed in the Nematoda, as is usual in animals which are, as a
  rule, either parasitic or live underground. Eyes, consisting of masses of dark pigment with or
  without a lens, occur in the neighbourhood of the circumoesophageal nerve-ring in some free-living
  forms. Leuckart described as possible auditory organs certain giant-cells lying near the orifice
  of the excretory ducts. Later research has shown these cells to have some phagocytic action on the
  contents of the body-cavity. The chief sense organs are the papillae, of which in <i>A.
  megalocephala</i> there are two kinds, the lip papillae being distinguished from the genital
  papillae by the fact that the nerve supplying them ends in a fine point and pierces the cuticle in
  the former case, whilst in the latter it swells out into an "end-organ," which is always covered
  by a layer of cuticle, though sometimes by a very thin one.</p>

  <p><b>Muscular System.</b>&mdash;The muscular system is one of the most characteristic features of
  the Nematoda, both as regards the histology of the muscle-cells and the way in which the cells are
  arranged.</p>

  <p>Each muscle-cell is of considerable size, and is of the shape of a somewhat flattened spindle
  produced into a process near the middle. Each end of the spindle cell is said to be continuous
  with the fibrils of the sub-cuticular layer.<a id="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>
  The muscle-cell consists of two portions, a contractile part which lies next the sub-cuticle, and
  which usually, to some extent, wraps round the second or medullary half. The latter consists of a
  fibrillar spongioplasm, in the meshes of which lies a clear structureless hyaloplasm. The nucleus
  always lies in the medullary half.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page129"><span class="smaller">{129}</span></span></div>

  <p>The contractile portion consists of a number of columns, very regularly arranged in two rows
  and close together, but allowing sufficient space between adjacent columns for fibrils of the
  spongioplasm to penetrate; and these become continuous with the fibrils of the sub-cuticle, which
  is thus intimately connected with both nervous and muscular systems.</p>

  <p>The medullary portion of the cell varies greatly in size; it may stretch far into the
  body-cavity, which may be thereby almost occluded, or it may be flattened out, leaving a large
  space around the alimentary canal. At one point, usually about its middle, it is produced into a
  process, which bends inwards towards the dorsal or ventral nerve-cord, and by means of this
  process the muscle receives its nerve supply.</p>

  <p>In most Nematodes there are numerous muscle-cells to be seen in any transverse section, forming
  a layer within the sub-cuticle, and broken up into four quadrants (Fig. 62) by the projection of
  the dorsal, ventral, and lateral thickenings of the sub-cuticular tissue. In some genera, however,
  such as <i>Oxyuris</i>, <i>Strongylus</i>, <i>Pelodera</i>, <i>Leptodera</i>, etc., there are but
  eight muscle-cells in a row, two in each quadrant. Such genera are classed together by
  Schneider,<a id="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> and termed Meromyarii (<i>vide</i>
  p. <a href="#page137">137</a>).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to the characteristic muscles of the body-wall there are others, such as those
  which move the spicules in the male, which cross the body-cavity obliquely near the anus, and such
  as sphincter muscles near the latter orifice, which have not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page130"><span class="smaller">{130}</span></span>the characteristic arrangement of
  contractile and medullary parts described above.</p>

  <p><b>The Body-Cavity.</b>&mdash;The skin of a Nematode, as described above, contains most of the
  important organs of the body within its thickness. The chief muscular system, the nervous system
  with its sense organs, and the excretory organs are all embedded in or form part of the skin,
  which in its turn encloses a cavity&mdash;the body-cavity&mdash;in which the other two systems of
  organs which are found in Nematodes lie. These are the digestive system and the reproductive
  system.</p>

  <p>The body-cavity is continuous from one end of the animal to the other, and is in no case
  divided up into compartments by the presence of septa or mesenteries. It contains a coagulable
  fluid with numerous corpuscles; this is, as a rule, colourless, but in <i>Syngamus trachealis</i>
  Sieb. (Fig. 70), which lives on blood, the haemoglobin of its host tinges it red, though the
  colour is said to disappear if the parasite be isolated and starved.</p>

  <p>The morphological nature of this body-cavity affords an interesting problem. It is not a true
  <i>coelom</i>, such as exists in the earthworm, since it is not surrounded by mesoderm, nor do the
  excretory organs, with the possible exception of one or two genera, open into it, nor do the
  generative cells arise from its walls. Essentially it is a space between the mesodermic
  muscle-cells which line the skin and the endodermic cells of the alimentary canal, and although in
  many of its functions it resembles the coelom of other animals, its morphological character is
  quite different.</p>

  <p>There are no respiratory or circulatory organs in the Nematoda; possibly the fluid in the
  body-cavity acts, to some extent, as a carrier of oxygen, but from the inert and almost vegetative
  life of these animals it seems probable that their respiratory processes are slow, and in fact
  Bunge<a id="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> has shown that <i>Ascaris mystax</i>,
  found in the intestine of the cat, will live for four or five days in media quite free from
  oxygen, and that <i>A. acus</i> from the pike will live and exhibit movements in the same media
  for from four to six days.</p>

  <p><b>The Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The mouth of the Nematoda is usually anterior and terminal,
  and is surrounded by from two to six projecting lips, the most common number being three. These
  <span class="pagenum" id="page131"><span class="smaller">{131}</span></span>lips are well provided
  with sense papillae. The mouth leads into an alimentary canal, which with hardly an exception runs
  straight through the body to the anus without twists or loops. The anus is usually placed
  ventrally and is not terminal, but in <i>Trichina</i> and <i>Trichocephalus</i> it is at the end
  of the body, and in <i>Mermis</i>, where the several parts of the alimentary canal are said not to
  communicate, it is absent altogether. <i>Ichthyonema</i>, <i>Dracunculus</i>, <i>Allantonema</i>,
  <i>Atractonema</i>, and other Filariae are also aproctous.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is divisible into three parts&mdash;(i.) the oesophagus, (ii.) the
  intestine, and (iii.) the rectum. The suctorial oesophagus is a very muscular, thick-walled tube,
  lined with cuticle continuous with that which covers the body, and like it cast from time to time.
  Its lumen is usually much reduced, and is almost invariably triangular or triradiate in section
  (Fig. 62). In many genera the hinder end of the oesophagus is swollen into a muscular bulb, which
  is armed with teeth in <i>Heterakis</i>, <i>Oxyuris</i>, <i>Pelodera</i>, <i>Leptodera</i>, etc.
  Other species, such as <i>Tylenchus</i>, <i>Aphelenchus</i>, <i>Dorylaimus</i>, are armed with a
  spear, which in <i>Onyx</i>,<a id="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> a genus recently
  described and allied to the last named, is borne on a special bulb. The use of the spear is to
  pierce the tissue upon the juices of which the animal lives. A gland lies embedded in the thick
  walls of the oesophagus, and opens into its lumen by a fine tube. This was first described by
  Schneider<a id="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> in <i>A. megalocephala</i>, and more
  recently it has been found by Hamann<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> in a
  number of Ascaridae and Strongylidae from the Adriatic, and also in <i>Lecanocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>With a few exceptions, such as <i>Mermis</i>, where it is blind, the oesophagus opens
  posteriorly into the intestine. This is a somewhat flattened tube, whose shape and position are
  often altered by the development of the generative organs. Its wall consists of a single layer of
  columnar cells, with large nuclei coated internally and externally by a layer of cuticle. The
  inner layer of cuticle is usually perforated by very numerous minute pores. In some species the
  intestine is degenerate, in <i>Mermis</i> it is a closed tube opening neither into the oesophagus
  nor into the rectum; in <i>Trichina spiralis</i> and in the larva of <i>Tylenchus tritici</i> it
  consists of a single row of cells perforated by a duct, but in the adult of the last named there
  are many cells in a transverse section.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page133"><span class="smaller">{133}</span></span></div>

  <p>In some genera, <i>Leptodera</i> and <i>Pelodera</i>, the lumen of the intestine at any one
  level is bounded by two horseshoe-shaped cells, but by far the commonest arrangement is a tube
  formed of fairly numerous columnar cells crowded with granules and with large nuclei.</p>

  <p>The rectum is usually short; its cuticular lining, like that of the oesophagus, is cast at
  intervals. At its anterior end there is usually a sphincter muscle, and its walls are divaricated
  by muscular strands which run from it to the body-wall. The anus is a transverse slit, which in
  the male Strongylidae is surrounded by a funnel-shaped membrane.</p>

  <p>The food of Nematodes seems to be almost entirely fluid, and consists, at any rate in the
  parasitic forms, of the elaborated juices of their hosts. Little is known about the nutriment of
  the free-living forms.</p>

  <p><b>The Excretory System.</b>&mdash;The excretory organs are peculiar, and, like many other
  Nematode structures, do not fall readily into line with what is known of similar organs in other
  animals. They consist of two canals embedded in the lateral thickenings of the sub-cuticular
  tissue. The canals end blindly behind, but near the anterior end of the body they bend inwards,
  and after uniting, open by a common pore situated in the middle ventral line, a little way behind
  the mouth. The lateral canals are in some cases continued in front of the transverse branch, and
  they then end blindly in the head. The walls of these canals consist of an internal,
  structureless, refractive layer surrounded by a granular layer with nuclei. They contain a fluid,
  but nothing is known of its composition.</p>

  <p>An interesting divergence from the usual form of excretory organ has been described by Hamann<a
  id="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> in the genus <i>Lecanocephalus</i>. Here there is
  only one canal, the right; anteriorly this bends towards the ventral surface and opens by a small
  median pore close behind the nerve-ring. Posteriorly the canal does not extend much beyond the
  middle of the body, where it forms a coiled mass, and diminishing in size, opens into the
  body-cavity. The same author also states that both canals in <i>Dochmius</i> have a similar
  internal opening; these observations, if confirmed,<a id="NtA_167"
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> show a conformity to the ordinary structure of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page134"><span class="smaller">{134}</span></span>excretory organs which was
  not supposed to exist in the lateral canals of the Nematoda.</p>

  <p><b>The Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;With the exception of the genera <i>Angiostomum</i>,
  <i>Pelodytes</i>, and of <i>Rhabdonema nigrovenosum</i>, which are physiologically hermaphrodite
  and self-impregnating, the Nematodes have separate sexes. The males are, as a rule, smaller than
  the females, and may usually be distinguished by the posterior end of the body being curved
  towards the ventral surface; a genital bursa, and one or more spicules are often found in this
  sex. Further, the position of the genital opening differs; in the male the vas deferens opens on
  the ventral surface of the rectum close to the anus, but the oviduct in the female opens in the
  ventral middle line, usually near the middle of the body, but sometimes close behind the excretory
  pore, or in some Strongylidae just in front of the anus. The tail of the male bears very numerous
  papillae, which are of considerable systematic importance.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With rare exceptions, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Filaria attenuata</i>, where it is double, the male
  reproductive organ consists of a single tube divisible into a testis proper, a vas deferens, a
  vesicula seminalis, where the spermatozoa are stored up, and a ductus ejaculatorius. The tube
  stretches through the body in a straight line in the small free-living forms, but is thrown into
  loops and coils in the larger parasitic Nematodes. Within the testis the mother-cells of the
  spermatozoa are attached to a rhachis or axial cord; the mother-cells divide, and their products
  ultimately form spermatozoa. The latter have a very peculiar shape; in accordance with the
  universal absence of cilia in the Nematoda the spermatozoon has no flagellum, and at first
  consists of a spherical nucleated cell, on one side of which a cap or covering of some refractive
  substance appears. The cap elongates and <span class="pagenum" id="page135"><span
  class="smaller">{135}</span></span>becomes conical, whilst the protoplasmic portion of the
  spermatozoon throws out pseudopodia and becomes amoeboid, but ultimately rounds itself off again.
  The spermatozoa do not attain maturity until they reach the uterus of the female.</p>

  <p>The internal female reproductive organs are, with few exceptions (<i>Trichina</i>, etc.),
  double, but the vagina, which is lined with cuticle continuous with that covering the body, is
  always single. They are usually much coiled, and may be divided into ovary, oviduct, and uterus.
  The ova arise from a polynucleated mass of protoplasm or syncytium (Fig. 65, <i>o</i>) at the
  upper end, and acquire distinctness as they approach the oviduct. Fertilisation takes place in the
  uterus, but the segmentation may not begin until some time after the eggs are laid; in
  <i>Dochmius</i>, however, it is well advanced at this period, and in many genera, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Pseudalius</i>, <i>Trichina</i>, <i>Dracunculus</i>, etc., the whole development of the larva
  takes place in the body of the mother.</p>

  <p><b>Embryology.</b>&mdash;The eggs of many of the parasitic forms require a considerable degree
  of warmth to develop. Those of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> require a temperature of 20&deg; C., those
  of <i>Trichocephalus</i> 22.5&deg; C., and those of <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>, 40&deg; C. The latter
  develop in a few hours, the eggs of <i>Dochmius</i> in a few days, whilst those of <i>A. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page136"><span class="smaller">{136}</span></span>lumbricoides</i> take weeks
  or even months, and the young of <i>Trichocephalus</i> seldom develop within a year.<a
  id="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> The ova only develop in a damp atmosphere, and
  they can be arrested at almost any stage, and for considerable periods, by desiccation.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the processes by which the fertilised egg-cell develops into the larva is very
  imperfect. As a rule the segmentation is complete and equal; it results in the formation of a
  blastula, which may take the form of a hollow sphere of cells&mdash;<i>A.
  megalocephala</i>&mdash;or the cavity may be reduced, and the blastula may consist of a
  double-layered plate, as in <i>Cucullanus</i>.<a id="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>
  The distinction into cells which will form the three embryonic layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and
  endoderm, is very early evident,&mdash;in the eight-cell stage. By the growth of one side of the
  blastula and the tucking in of the other the blastula becomes converted into a gastrula, which is
  a two-layered stage with a cavity opening to the exterior by a pore termed the blastopore. In
  Nematodes the blastopore is elongated and slit-like; it either forms the mouth (<i>Cucullanus</i>)
  or closes from behind forwards, the mouth ultimately arising at the point where the blastopore
  finally closed (<i>Rhabdonema nigrovenosum</i>). The mesodermal cells lie between the ectoderm and
  the endoderm; they ultimately develop into the muscles of the body-wall, the lateral excretory
  canals, and the reproductive organs; the last-named two systems arise each<a id="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> from a single cell. The nervous system arises from the
  ectoderm, which also forms the sub-cuticle, and is turned in slightly at the mouth and anus; the
  remainder of the alimentary canal develops from the endoderm.</p>

  <p>The post-embryonic development, which is very variable, and in many cases very extraordinary,
  will be dealt with under the several families.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The classification of the Nematodes is a matter of very
  considerable difficulty; their structure is unusually monotonous, and, owing perhaps to their
  largely parasitic mode of life, they show practically none of those external features which are so
  useful to the systematist in other groups. Schneider in his Monograph divides the group into three
  subdivisions&mdash;(i.) <span class="pagenum" id="page137"><span
  class="smaller">{137}</span></span>the <b>Polymyarii</b>, in which numerous muscle cells are seen
  in a transverse section; (ii.) the <b>Meromyarii</b>, in which only eight are seen, two in each
  quadrant; and (iii.) the <b>Holomyarii</b>, in which the muscles are either not divided, or only
  divided by longitudinal lines. This grouping has, however, to some extent broken down, since
  B&uuml;tschli<a id="NtA_171" href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> and others have shown that the third
  subdivision is founded on insufficient observation, whilst the first two include, in different
  subdivisions, Nematodes which are closely allied in all respects except as regards their muscle
  cells.</p>

  <p>The details of the life-history have been used by other writers as a basis of classification.
  Linstow<a id="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> enumerates fourteen distinct
  modifications of the post-embryonic development (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#page159">159</a>), and
  &Ouml;rley<a id="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> has grouped these under three headings.
  The animals which fall under each group to some extent resemble one another in structure. &Ouml;rley's
  groups are<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(i.) <b>Nematozoa</b>.&mdash;Thread-worms with free larval life, the mature forms being
  parasitic in animals. Enormous numbers of eggs are produced, and the development is indirect. The
  genital organs are complicated by many convolutions.</p>

  <p>(ii.) <b>Rhabditiformae</b>.&mdash;Small, as a rule microscopic, thread-worms, usually living
  free, but rarely parasitic. They become sexually mature only in decomposing organic substances, or
  in earth saturated with such substances. They live gregariously and do not produce immense numbers
  of ova. The metamorphosis is slight, or is complicated by sexual metamorphosis. The oesophagus has

  <p>The determination of the species to which a Nematode belongs is a matter of considerable
  difficulty. Amongst the more important features for purposes of classification are the arrangement
  of the <span class="pagenum" id="page138"><span class="smaller">{138}</span></span>muscles, the
  character of the tail in the male, especially when papillae are present, the number and the size
  of the spicules, and the arrangement of the lips and mouth-parts generally.</p>

  <p>Cobb<a id="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> has recently devised an ingenious
  formula in which measurements of different parts of the body appear as percentages of the whole
  length of the body. The nature of this will be understood by reference to Fig. 68. Such a formula
  should, however, be used with caution, since it rests on the assumption that the proportions of
  the various parts of the body are constant in different individuals, and it is by no means certain
  that this is the case.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Taking everything into consideration, it has seemed advisable in the following
  systematic account of the Nematoda to abandon the larger groups, and to deal directly with the
  families. Claus distinguishes seven of these, and the diagnoses given at the head of each are
  mainly taken from his <i>Grundz&uuml;ge der Zoologie</i>.<a id="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>I. Family Ascaridae.</b></p>

  <p>Body rather stout. A dorsal and two ventro-lateral lips, bearing papillae. Buccal cavity
  distinct, seldom provided with chitinous armature. The oesophagus often has two dilatations. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page139"><span class="smaller">{139}</span></span>The tail of the male is
  ventrally curved, and usually there are two horny spicules. The Ascaridae are found in the
  intestines of their respective hosts.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Ascaris</i>, <i>Heterakis</i>, <i>Oxyuris</i>, <i>Nematoxys</i>, <i>Oxysoma</i>, and
  many others.</p>

  <p>Von Linstow<a id="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> enumerates over 250 species of
  <i>Ascaris</i>, of which it will only be possible to mention here one or two. They are all
  parasitic in Vertebrata.</p>

  <p><i>A. lumbricoides</i> Linn. is one of the largest known Nematodes &#x2642; = 4-6 in., &#x2640;
  = 10-14 in.; Figs. 66 and 67). It is a common parasite in man, and has been found in the ox. It is
  now generally recognised as the same parasite which inhabits the pig, and which Dujardin regarded
  as specifically distinct, and named <i>A. suillae</i>. In the latter host, however, it never
  attains the dimensions it does in man. It inhabits the upper and middle parts of the small
  intestine, and has been known to escape into the body-cavity and set up abscesses there, or to
  make its way into the stomach, and to be voided through the mouth. It is practically cosmopolitan
  in distribution, and is very common in Japan&mdash;Baely found it in twenty-one out of
  twenty-three <i>post-mortems</i>&mdash;and in Tonquin and tropical Africa. Heller<a id="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> states that no one is free from these worms in Finland, and
  they are common wherever there is a plentiful water supply, as in the marshy districts of Holland
  and Sweden. In Iceland alone they seem absent. When examined alive they give off an irritating
  vapour which seriously affects some observers, causing catarrhal symptoms, which in Bastian's case
  lasted six weeks. The usual number found in one host is small, one to six or eight, but cases are
  on record where many hundreds occurred in one person.</p>

  <p>The details of the life-history of this form are not yet completely worked out. The eggs leave
  the body of the host with the excreta, and formerly it was thought they re-entered the alimentary
  canal in drinking-water, etc., and there developed into the adult without change of host. This
  view has been combated by Leuckart, who failed to rear the Nematodes by direct feeding, and it has
  been noticed that the youngest parasites found in the <span class="pagenum" id="page140"><span
  class="smaller">{140}</span></span>intestine are already 2 to 3 mm. long. Von Linstow has recently
  suggested that the larval stages may be hatched out in the body of the millipede <i>Julus
  guttulatus</i>, whose habits might easily lead it to eat the eggs of the parasite in manured
  gardens, etc., and which is itself sometimes unconsciously eaten when hidden in fruit or
  vegetables. This would account for the frequent presence of the parasite in pigs, and also for the
  fact that in man it is commonest in children who are apt to eat windfalls, and in maniacs and
  people with perverted tastes.</p>

  <p><i>A. megalocephala</i>, which is found in the horse, ass, zebra, ox, etc., attains even
  greater dimensions than the foregoing. The male rarely exceeds 7 inches in length, but the female
  sometimes reaches 17 inches. They are found in the small intestine of their hosts. Cobbold<a
  id="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> succeeded in rearing larvae which attained a high
  degree of organisation when the eggs were placed amongst moist horse-dung, and it seems probable
  that the larvae pass into the body of their hosts in drinking water; at any rate no intermediate
  host has yet been found, and Davaine, who fed cows, and Leuckart, who fed horses with the
  unhatched eggs, both failed to infect the animals they experimented on. <i>A. mystax</i>, which
  lives in cats, dogs, and other Carnivora, has also been found in man. It is provided with fin-like
  extensions on the side of its head (cf. Fig. 62), and varies much in size in different hosts. When
  first found in man it received the name of <i>A. alata</i>. It becomes sexually mature in about
  three weeks.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable cycles of development amongst the many curious life-histories met
  with amongst Nematodes, is that presented by <i>Rhabdonema</i> (<i>Ascaris</i>)
  <i>nigrovenosum</i>. The free form of this, formerly known as a distinct species, <i>Rhabditis
  nigrovenosa</i>, lives in the excrement of frogs, and attains sexual maturity in a very short
  time. The sexes pair, and the fertilised ova give rise to embryos which hatch out within the body
  of the mother, and then begin to devour her internal organs. After the destruction of the mother,
  the embryos escape and live in water or slime, and sometimes burrow into water snails, but they
  undergo no change until swallowed by a frog. Then they make their way into its lungs and grow
  enormously, attaining a length of almost an inch. This form, parasitic in the frog, is a
  protandrous hermaphrodite, which first produces spermatozoa and afterwards <span class="pagenum"
  id="page141"><span class="smaller">{141}</span></span>ova; the latter are fertilised by the
  spermatozoa, and give rise to rhabditiform embryos, which escape by the alimentary canal and form
  the free-living sexual stage mentioned above. Thus in the life-history of this form we find an
  alternation of generation, a sexual free-living form alternating with a hermaphrodite parasitic
  form.</p>

  <p>Of the enormous number of other species of the genus, only a very few can be mentioned. <i>A.
  transfuga</i> Rud. inhabits bears; <i>A. leptoptera</i> Rud., lions; <i>A. ferox</i> H. and
  Ehrbg., Hyracoidea; <i>A. depressa</i> Rud., vultures; <i>A. rubicunda</i> Schn., pythons; <i>A.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Oxyuris</i> is Meromyarian (see p. <a href="#page137">137</a>), and is characterised by the
  long capillary tail of the female. It includes another human parasite, <i>O. vermicularis</i>, and
  it is one which it is difficult to get rid of. The female has the characteristic tail and is about
  10 mm. long. The male is smaller. They are found in the caecum and rectum of man, and cause great
  irritation and sometimes serious functional disturbance. The eggs are laid in immense numbers but
  perish in water. If whilst still in the egg-shell the larvae are swallowed on fruit or raw
  vegetables, etc., they are set free in the stomach and small intestine by the action of the
  digestive secretions. The distribution of this parasite is universal. Besides numerous species
  that inhabit the alimentary canal of Vertebrates, such as <i>O. ambigua</i> Rud., found in hares
  and rabbits; <i>O. curvula</i> Rud., in <span class="pagenum" id="page142"><span
  class="smaller">{142}</span></span>the caecum of horses; <i>O. megatyphlon</i> Rud., in iguanas;
  several species inhabit the rectum of insects, such as <i>O. blattae</i>, <i>O. diesingi</i>,
  <i>O. blatticola</i>, found in the cockroach; <i>O. spirotheca</i>, and <i>O. hydrophili</i> in
  the water beetle <i>Hydrophilus</i>.<a id="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Nematoxys</i> has the most complex arrangement of muscles of any Meromyarian, and
  forms a transition to the Polymyarian type. The whole body of both sexes is covered with numerous
  irregularly scattered papillae. The members of this genus have hitherto been found in snakes,
  Amphibia, and eels; there are but few species.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Oxysoma</i> is another small genus with but three species, found in the
  intestines of opossums, frogs, and turtles respectively.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>II. Family Strongylidae.</b></p>

  <p>Mouth surrounded by papillae; an armature of teeth or spines often present. The chitinous
  lining of the intestine projects into the interior as ridges. No oesophageal bulb. The male
  orifice at the posterior end of the body is surrounded by a bell-shaped bursa.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Eustrongylus</i>, <i>Strongylus</i>, <i>Dochmius</i>, <i>Sclerostomum</i>,
  <i>Cucullanus</i>, <i>Syngamus</i>, <i>Pseudalius</i>, <i>Ollulanus</i>, and others.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Eustrongylus</i> includes two species, <i>E. gigas</i> Rud. and <i>E. tubifex</i>
  Nitsch. The former attains in the female the gigantic length of 860 mm., with a breadth of 7 mm.
  and a weight of over 40 grs.<a id="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> The male is a
  quarter to a third as long as the female. This parasite inhabits the kidney capsules of
  carnivorous animals, especially of those that eat fish, such as dogs, seals, etc., and has
  occasionally been found in man, the horse, and the deer. It frequently destroys the substance of
  the kidney. The worms are red in colour. The eggs die when exposed to desiccation for a few days,
  but have been kept alive for fifteen months in water; it is believed by Schneider and Leuckart
  that they are eaten by fish, and that the larvae form the <i>Filaria cystica</i> found in the
  peritoneal membrane of the fishes <i>Galaxias scriba</i> and <i>Symbranchus laticaudatus</i>, and
  that they pass into their final host, where they become sexually mature, by the latter eating raw
  fish. <i>E. tubifex</i> is found in aquatic birds, <i>e.g.</i> ducks, grebes, and divers, etc.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page143"><span class="smaller">{143}</span></span></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Strongylus</i> is easily recognised by its conspicuous genital bursa, strengthened
  by variously arranged ridges which are of specific value. There are numerous species, found in man
  and many other mammals, and also in birds and reptiles. Some species inhabit the intestine, others
  form aneurisms in the large blood-vessels, and cause considerable mortality amongst horses; others
  live in the tracheae and lungs of cattle and sheep, their presence often causing great loss to the
  farmer. No intermediate host has been satisfactorily demonstrated; the larvae live in damp earth,
  and it seems almost certain that they pass directly into their host with its food.</p>

  <p><i>Dochmius</i> (<i>Ancylostomum</i>) <i>duodenalis</i>, called by Neumann<a id="NtA_182"
  href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> <i>Uncinaria duodenalis</i>, is one of the most dangerous
  parasites that attack man. It lives in the duodenum and jejunum, and the fertilised eggs leave the
  body of its host with the excreta, and in damp earth develop into larvae in the course of a few
  days. These at first eat voraciously, but after undergoing several moults they cease to take food
  and pass into the resting stage. If now they are swallowed with drinking water, they come to rest
  in the small intestine of their host, and in a few weeks become sexually mature. They cause great
  harm by burrowing in the intestinal walls and destroying the capillaries. They are found by
  hundreds, and even thousands, in the same host, and produce profound anaemia, which is frequently
  fatal to miners, and was the cause of a great mortality amongst the workers in the St. Gothard
  Tunnel some fifteen years ago. This species is very widely spread over the face of the globe.
  <i>Dochmius trigonocephala</i> Rud. and <i>D. stenocephala</i> produce similar diseases in dogs
  and cats, and <i>D. cernua</i> Crep. is found in sheep and goats.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cucullanus</i> exists in the adult form in the intestines of fishes, and more
  rarely of reptiles. <i>C. elegans</i> Zed., which live in fresh-water fish, <i>e.g.</i> the perch,
  is viviparous; after birth the young pass into the water and make their way into the alimentary
  canal of the small crustacean <i>Cyclops</i>, and thence into its body-cavity. Here they undergo
  two moults, accompanied by certain changes in structure. If this second host be swallowed by a
  fish the parasites are set free, and develop generative organs. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page144"><span class="smaller">{144}</span></span><i>Ollulanus tricuspis</i> Leuck., which in
  the adult state is found in the cat, chiefly in the intestine but also in the bronchi and other
  parts, gives rise to larvae which are of enormous size compared with the parent; these leave the
  body, and if eaten by a mouse encyst in its muscles, and if the mouse be devoured by a cat, they
  complete their life-cycle by becoming sexually mature.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Syngamus</i> infests the trachea and bronchi of birds, more rarely of mammals. The
  <i>red-</i> or <i>forked-worm</i>, <i>Syngamus trachealis</i> Sieb., is common in poultry and game
  birds, and causes the disease known as gapes, which is especially common in young birds, and often
  gives rise to extensive loss. The peculiarity of this genus is that the male is permanently
  attached to the female, its genital bursa being so closely adherent to the opening of the oviduct
  that two specimens cannot be separated without tearing the tissues. The ova are not laid, but
  escape from the body with fully-formed embryos in them, by the decay or rupture of their parent's
  body. They hatch in damp earth or water in from one to six weeks according to the temperature.
  When swallowed by a fowl they develop into adults, which reproduce eggs in less than three weeks.
  No second host is needed, but the embryos remain alive in the alimentary canal of earthworms, and
  these doubtless to some extent serve to spread the disease.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>III. Family Trichotrachelidae.</b></p>

  <p>This family is characterised by the anterior end of the body being produced into a long
  whip-like neck. The mouth is small and devoid of papillae. The oesophagus is very long, and it
  traverses a peculiar strand of cells.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Trichocephalus</i>, <i>Trichina</i>, <i>Trichosoma</i>, and others.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page145"><span class="smaller">{145}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Trichocephalus dispar</i> Rud. (<i>hominis</i> Gmel.) is common in man, and also occurs in
  some species of monkey. It does not live freely within the intestine, but buries its long
  whip-like anterior end in the mucous lining of the caecum or colon. The eggs pass out of the body
  of the host. The development of the embryo is slow, lasting many months; whilst still in the
  egg-shell the embryos are swallowed, and give rise to the sexually-mature parasite without the
  intervention of an intermediate host. They are by no means uncommon. Davaine calculated that about
  50 per cent of the inhabitants of Paris were infested with them, but they give rise to little
  disturbance, and only very occasionally cause serious harm. <i>T. affinis</i> Rud. infests sheep;
  <i>T. crenatus</i> Rud. the pig; <i>T. depressiusculus</i> Rud. the dog; and <i>T.
  unguiculatus</i> Rud. the hare and rabbit.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Trichosoma</i>, with many species, is as a rule found in birds, but it occurs also
  in mammals, as <i>T. plica</i> Rud. in the bladder of the fox and wolf, <i>T. felis cati</i> in
  the bladder of the cat, <i>T. aerophilum</i> Duj. in the trachea of the fox and marten. The chief
  interest of this genus is that, at any rate in <i>T. crassicauda</i> Bel., which infests the rat,
  the dwarf males live two, three, or four at a time within the uterus of the female, a condition of
  things which recalls the similar arrangement found in the Gephyrean <i>Bonellia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Trichina spiralis</i> is the cause of the well-known disease trichinosis, which appears in
  two forms, intestinal and muscular, according to the habitat of the parasite. The mature forms of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page146"><span class="smaller">{146}</span></span>both sexes are found
  in the intestine of man and many other mammals. They have been experimentally developed in birds,
  though in the latter the larval forms have never been observed. By keeping such cold-blooded
  animals as the salamander at a constant temperature, Goujon and Legros succeeded in infecting
  them, but the larvae perished as soon as the artificial heat was withdrawn. Muscular trichinosis
  is unknown in fishes, but the sexual form develops in their intestine.</p>

  <p>The adult parasites of the intestine are scarcely visible to the naked eye; the females are 3
  to 4 mm. long and more numerous than the males, which measure 1.4 to 1.6 mm. The eggs are very
  numerous, a single female containing at one time 1200, and probably producing ten times as many
  during her life. The embryos are hatched out within the uterus, and the larvae leave the body of
  the mother through the generative pore. The minute larvae bore through the intestinal walls of
  their host, and then, either burrowing in the tissues or swept along in the stream of blood or
  lymph, make their way all over the body, and come to rest most usually in the muscles, but
  occasionally in other parts. When the larva reaches its resting-place, it either pierces the
  sarcolemma and establishes itself within the substance of the muscle-fibre, or it comes to rest
  between and not in the fibres. Here its presence sets up the formation of a spindle-shaped cyst
  which usually contains but one larva, though any number up to seven have been found in one cyst.
  Within this the larva may remain dormant for years, the walls of the cyst gradually undergoing a
  fatty or calcareous degeneration. Almost any muscle may be affected; those most usually infested
  being the muscles of the diaphragm, of the shoulder-blade, and of the lumbar region; the larvae
  have also been found in the heart. The ends of the muscles near their points of attachment are
  always the most thoroughly infested.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The number of the encapsuled larvae in one host is enormous. Leuckart counted between 12,000
  and 15,000 in a gramme of muscle, which would give a total of thirty to forty million parasites in
  one host; other estimates place the total even higher.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page147"><span class="smaller">{147}</span></span></div>

  <p>When trichinised meat is eaten, unless it has been thoroughly cooked, the cysts are dissolved
  and the larvae are set free. Within three or four days they become sexually mature and their ova
  begin to segment. The males after a time leave the body with the excreta and perish, whilst the
  larvae of the new brood make their way into the tissues of the host.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Man usually acquires trichinosis by eating uncooked or improperly-cooked pork, and
  the disease is so widely spread and of such a serious nature that most civilised countries have
  adopted rigorous methods for the detection of trichinised meat. The pigs either acquire the
  disease by eating uncooked swine's flesh, which is frequently given them in the form of offal, or
  by devouring rats, which are very susceptible to the disease.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>IV. Family Filariidae.</b></p>

  <p>Mouth with two lips, or without lips. Six oral papillae often present, and sometimes a horny
  oral capsule. Four pre-anal pairs of papillae, and sometimes an unpaired one as well. Two unequal
  spicula or a single one.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Filaria</i>, <i>Ichthyonema</i>, <i>Hystrichis</i>, <i>Spiroptera</i>,
  <i>Dispharagus</i>, and others.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Filaria</i> is a very large one. Like <i>Ascaris</i>, it is confined to
  Vertebrates, but usually lives in the tissues of the body and not in the intestines. <i>F.</i>
  (<i>Dracunculus</i>) <i>medinensis</i> Gmel., the guinea-worm, is well known as a human parasite
  in hot countries; it also occurs in the horse and dog. The female has an average length of 50 to
  80 cm., but gigantic forms with a length of 4 metres have been described. The alimentary canal is
  degenerate. In adult females the body is completely occupied by a uterus crowded with eggs and
  embryos, which can only escape by the rupture of the mother's body, as the genital ducts have
  disappeared. Its original home is tropical Asia and Africa, but it has been introduced into South
  America with the negroes.</p>

  <p>The female lives coiled up in the subcutaneous tissues, usually in those of the legs. Its
  presence gives rise to painful tumours. When these break the female protrudes, and may be
  withdrawn from the body by very carefully rolling it round a stick or pencil. This must be done
  very slowly, a few inches a day, as the rupture of the body sets free the contained embryos, and
  may result in <span class="pagenum" id="page148"><span class="smaller">{148}</span></span>the
  death of the host. The embryos normally bore their way into the body of the fresh-water
  <i>Cyclops</i>, and are re-introduced into their Vertebrate hosts with the drinking-water. It is
  usually stated that the female alone is known, and that it is uncertain whether it is
  hermaphrodite or whether both sexes are present in the <i>Cyclops</i>. Recently Dr. Charles<a
  id="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> has described a specimen found in the mesentery
  of a human subject, from an orifice in the middle of whose body he was able to draw a much smaller

  <p><i>Filaria immitis</i> Leidy, the cruel worm, is common in dogs in China and the East
  generally. It is not unknown in America and Europe. It occurs in such large clusters in the right
  ventricle that it is difficult to see how the circulation can proceed. The intermediate host is
  unknown, but from the prevalence of the <span class="pagenum" id="page149"><span
  class="smaller">{149}</span></span>disease in marshy country it is probably some aquatic animal.
  The larvae are said by Manson to disappear from the peripheral circulation of the dog during the
  day, but not to such a marked extent as do the <i>F. sanguinis hominis</i> Lew., var.
  <i>nocturna</i> Man. They were found by Galeb and Pourquier in the foetus of an infested bitch, a
  fact which establishes the transmission of such parasites through the placenta.</p>

  <p><i>Filaria sanguinis hominis nocturna.</i>&mdash;The female of this parasite has been described
  as living in the lymphatic glands of man. The embryos escape from it into the lymph, and thus
  reach the blood. According to Manson the intermediate host is the mosquito, in whose stomach the
  embryos undergo their larval changes. When the mosquito dies the larvae escape into the water, and
  then make their way into the alimentary canal of man, where they are believed to pair, and whence
  the female makes its way to the lymphatics. The presence of this <i>Filaria</i> causes great
  functional disturbance. One of the most remarkable features of it is that the larvae, which are
  very numerous in the blood during the night, disappear during the day, and are not to be found.
  Recently Manson<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> has described two new
  varieties: <i>F. san. hom. diurna</i>, in which the conditions of things are reversed, the larvae
  being found by day and not by night; and <i>F. san. hom. perstans</i>, in which the larvae occur
  both by day and by night. The larvae are long-lived, and were found by Manson in the blood of a
  negro who had not been in Africa, where it is endemic, for six years. The same observer is
  inclined to associate the presence of <i>F. san. hom. perstans</i> with the fatal disease known as
  "sleeping sickness." He also suggests that the mature form of the variety <i>diurna</i> is the
  <i>F. loa</i>, which is not uncommon in the eyes of negroes, and that its intermediate host may be
  one of the blood-sucking flies so common on the west coast of Africa.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Ichthyonema</i> is confined to fishes. The male is very minute and the female
  partly degenerate. It has no anus and no external opening to its generative organs. The uterus
  fills up almost the whole of the body-cavity. <i>I. sanguineum</i> Rud. is found encapsuled in the
  peritoneum of many fish.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Hystrichis</i> and <i>Dispharagus</i> are confined to birds, where they occur in
  the oesophagus and stomach. <i>Spiroptera reticulata</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page150"><span
  class="smaller">{150}</span></span>Crep. occurs in horses, twisted in a spiral round tendons and
  muscles, forming tumours which require to be opened.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>V. Family Mermithidae.</b></p>

  <p>Nematodes without anus and with six mouth papillae. Two spicules in the males and three rows of
  numerous papillae.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Mermis</i>, <i>Bradynema</i>, <i>Atractonema</i>, <i>Allantonema</i>,
  <i>Sphaerularia</i>, and others.</p>

  <p>As a rule the Nematoda show but little trace of their parasitic mode of life, but in this
  family there is considerable degeneration, and in extreme cases the body of the female is reduced
  to a simple sac crowded with eggs. They are exclusively parasitic in insects. In some respects
  their structure shows a transition towards <i>Nectonema</i> and the Gordiidae; especially is this
  the case in the structure of their ventral nerve-cord.</p>

  <p>The sexual form of <i>Mermis nigrescens</i> Duj.<a id="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> lives in damp earth, and after storms and in the early morning
  is sometimes found in such numbers crawling up the stalks of plants, as to give rise to the
  popular idea that there has been a shower of worms. The male is unknown; the female lays her eggs
  in the ground, and there they hatch out. It is not known exactly how the larvae make their way
  into the grasshoppers in whose body-cavity they live, but in an allied species, <i>M. albicans</i>
  v.&nbsp;Sieb., the larvae have been observed boring their way into small caterpillars through
  their skin, and it seems probable that the larvae of <i>M. nigrescens</i> burrow in a similar way
  into young Orthoptera.</p>

  <p><i>Bradynema rigidum</i> Leuck.<a id="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> is found in
  the adult stage living freely in the body-cavity of a small beetle <i>Aphodius fimetarius</i>, one
  of the Scarabeidae, from two to three to as many as thirty being found in one host, which does not
  seem much injured by their presence. The parasite is without mouth, anus, or excretory pore. The
  eggs hatch out in the uterus of the mother, and the larvae are male and female; they make their
  way into the body-cavity of the host, and here they pass an unusually long time, five months,
  soaking in osmotically the nutriment contained in the blood of the insect. Eventually they burrow
  through the walls of <span class="pagenum" id="page151"><span
  class="smaller">{151}</span></span>the intestine, and leaving the body of their host through the
  anus, find their way to the earth. Here, according to zur Strassen, the females die without
  playing any part in the perpetuation of the species. The males, on the other hand, having
  developed spermatozoa whilst in the larval stage (paedogenesis), afterwards form ova, and are in
  fact protandrous hermaphrodites, and become the mature parasites of the beetle, though how they
  enter the body of the host is unknown.</p>

  <p>The phenomenon presented by the hermaphroditism of <i>Bradynema</i> is, as far as we know, at
  present unique, as, though some other Nematodes are hermaphrodite, in their case the hermaphrodite
  form alternates with a bisexual generation. It is further interesting as showing a means by which
  hermaphroditism may arise, by the suppression of the females and the assumption of their functions
  by the male. In the case of <i>Rhabdonema nigrovenosum</i>, no females appear in the alternate
  generation.</p>

  pair in the damp earth and give rise to larvae which make their way into the body of the
  beetle-grubs. Here they undergo very extensive retrogressive change. The body of the female, which
  becomes the shape of a thick sausage, is encapsuled and surrounded by a curious hypertrophied
  network of tracheae (Fig. 74). As is usually the case with the degenerate parasitic forms, there
  are practically no organs but the ovary, and this is <span class="pagenum" id="page153"><span

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Atractonema gibbosum</i>, which lives in the body-cavity of the larva of
  <i>Cecidomyia pini</i>, has a similar life-history, but the parasitic form has a structural
  peculiarity which merits attention (Fig. 75). At the time of sexual maturity a swelling, which is
  caused by the prolapsus of the uterus and vagina, appears at the posterior end of the body; this
  swelling increases until it equals the rest of the body of the Nematode in size. Even this is far
  surpassed by a similar protuberance in <i>Sphaerularia bombi</i>, where the evaginated sac grows
  with such extreme rapidity that in a few weeks its length increases from .25 mm. to 15 mm. and its
  volume 60,000-fold, the increase being due, according to Leuckart, to the increase in size of the
  individual cells and not to their multiplication. The Nematode which has produced this enormous
  growth gets relatively smaller and smaller, and ultimately drops off (Fig. 76). The sexual larvae
  which arise from the eggs in this sac leave the body of the bee in which this species is parasitic
  by the anus, <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span class="smaller">{154}</span></span>and may
  live in damp earth, moss, etc., for months without taking nourishment, until the autumn, when they
  become sexually mature and, according to Leuckart, pair. The fertilised female is believed to bore
  her way into the humble-bee whilst the latter is seeking her underground winter quarters; this
  accounts for the fact that only queen bees are infected. The parasite is widely distributed both
  in Europe and North America; it is found in many species of <i>Bombus</i>, but most frequently in
  <i>B. lapidarius</i> and <i>B. terrestris</i>. The presence of the <i>Sphaerularia</i> affects the
  reproductive organs of the host, and reduces their fertility, so that an infected queen bee never
  succeeds in forming a colony.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>VI. Family Anguillulidae.</b></p>

  <p>For the most part free living and of small size. The oesophagus has usually a double swelling
  or two oesophageal bulbs. The male has two equal spicula.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Diplogaster</i>, <i>Mononchus</i>, <i>Rhabditis</i>, <i>Tylenchus</i>,
  <i>Anguillula</i>, and many others.</p>

  <p>Many species of this family live in humus or decaying matter; others live on, or are parasitic
  in, plants; some, such as <i>Anguillula aceti</i>, which is found in vinegar and in paste, live in
  organic fluids.</p>

  <p>The part played by the presence of these Nematodes in the soil is not thoroughly understood;
  sometimes they occur in great numbers, and even when not directly parasitic in plants, probably do
  them much damage. Cobb<a id="NtA_190" href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> has recently described
  from Australia and Fiji over eighty species, one-half of them new, which occur mostly in the
  earth, and many of them among plant roots. They frequently crawl up on to plants, especially on to
  seedlings. An instance of this is given as follows: "The edible part of three bunches of
  nice-looking celery bought of a Chinaman in Sydney was cut off as far up as it was tender, nearly
  to the first leaflets. It was washed by hand in a tin dish in tank water, free from Nematodes. The
  washings gave about 200 to 300 Nematodes, belonging to five different genera."</p>

  <p>It is very probable that many of the free-living forms which have received distinct specific
  names may ultimately turn out to be but stages in the life-history of some of the parasitic
  species. <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span class="smaller">{155}</span></span>Von Linstow<a
  id="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> has pointed out that the free form of <i>A.
  diplogaster</i>, if found alone, would be placed in the genus <i>Diplogaster</i>; similarly the
  bisexual form of <i>Ascaris nigrovenosa</i> is known as <i>Rhabditis nigrovenosa</i>.</p>

  <p>Those Nematodes which live parasitically in plants, <i>e.g.</i> many of the genera
  <i>Tylenchus</i> and <i>Aphelenchus</i> and <i>Heterodera</i>, as well as those which only pierce
  the epidermis of the roots (the remaining species of the above-named genera), are provided with a
  spine which works to and fro through the mouth and assists the animal to bore into the tissues of
  the plant. <i>Tylenchus devastatrix</i> lives and reproduces in leaves and stems (never in the
  roots, except in the case of hops<a id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>) of many
  cultivated plants, such as rye, oats, onions, etc. "Clover sickness" is probably caused by this
  Nematode. The plants become infected by the thread-worms in the soil during the spring; their
  presence causes swellings and often kills the plant, in which case the worms return to the soil or
  remain in the straw.</p>

  <p><i>Tylenchus tritici</i> Need. is the cause of "ear-cockles" in corn. These take the form of
  brown or purple galls, which replace the grains of corn, and which contain hundreds of minute
  Nematodes. In these galls they are motionless, and are capable of surviving in dryness for at
  least twenty years; but when moistened,&mdash;for instance, by the gall falling on damp
  earth,&mdash;they resume their vitality and make their way to the young wheat plants, and then,
  wriggling up the leaves and stems, find their way to the ear. Here they pair, and producing a
  gall-like growth in the flower, lay numerous eggs, from which arise the Nematodes of the
  ear-cockle.</p>

  plants, in England especially on the roots of tomatoes and cucumbers. The free larvae live in the
  earth and make their way into the smaller rootlets; here the female larvae shed their skin, lose
  their characteristic Nematode form, and become citron-shaped (Fig. 78, D). The male larvae undergo
  a change, and after a period of rest cast their skin and, leaving the rootlet, seek out the
  females. The female does not undergo this second ecdysis, but its generative organs grow and
  mature in what is practically a larval stage. The embryos develop within the body of the mother,
  and, escaping through the uterus, ultimately cause her death. They then make their way into the
  earth. The cycle of the development takes but four or five weeks, so that, as in the case of
  <i>Tylenchus devastatrix</i>, there are several broods in a year; <i>T. tritici</i>, on the other

  <p>Vuillemin and Legrain<a id="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> point out that while
  <i>Heterodera</i> is injurious to cultivated plants growing in damp soil, its presence is
  advantageous to those that grow in deserts. It is very common in the Sahara, and attacks many
  plants which are <span class="pagenum" id="page157"><span
  class="smaller">{157}</span></span>immune from it elsewhere. It causes the rootlets to swell out,
  and the bladder-like extensions thus formed act as reservoirs for water.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Many other species attack plants; <i>Tylenchus millefolii</i> L&ouml;w forms galls on
  <i>Achillea</i>, <i>T. dipsaci</i> K&uuml;hn. on the teazle. They all seem to have great powers of
  resisting desiccation. The former species, when dried and placed in a herbarium in May, gave rise
  to active worms when moistened the following October; and the corn eel-worm is said to survive
  twenty-seven years in a state of suspended animation. On the other hand, although these Nematodes
  like moisture, they cannot withstand submersion in water for any time. They can resist a
  considerable degree of cold, and a species, <i>Aphelenchus nivalis</i> Auriv.,<a id="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> has been described from Spitzbergen, where it lives in the

  <p class="ac"><b>VII. Family Enoplidae.</b></p>

  <p>Small, as a rule free-living, usually marine Nematodes, without a second oesophageal bulb. Eyes
  and mouth-armature often present. Fine hairs and bristles sometimes surround the mouth.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Enoplus</i>, <i>Dorylaimus</i>, <i>Enchelidium</i>, and others.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Enoplus</i> is exclusively marine, living amongst Algae and Hydroids in shallow
  water and moving actively about, but never coiling into spirals. De Man<a id="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> describes <i>Enoplus brevis</i> Bast. as being attacked by a
  plant parasite, probably a Bacterium, of a greenish colour, which infested the muscles and gave
  them a peculiar colour.</p>

  <p>Numerous other species have been described by De Man from the coast of Holland. It is probable
  that some of them are the free stages of parasitic forms; a brackish water species found in the
  East Indies (<i>Dorylaimus palustris</i>) is regarded by Carter as the larva of <i>Filaria
  medinensis</i>. <i>Oncholaimus echini</i> Leyd. is parasitic in the intestine of the sea-urchin
  <i>Echinus esculentus</i>. <i>Tricoma cincta</i><a id="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> has a strongly striated cuticle, which gives it almost the

  surrounded by bristle-bearing papillae.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span class="smaller">{158}</span></span></div>

  <p>Here must be mentioned two families closely allied to the true Nematodes.</p>

  <p>(i.) <b>Chaetosomatidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes three genera: <i>Chaetosoma</i>,
  <i>Rhabdogaster</i>, and <i>Tristicochaeta</i>. According to Metschnikoff,<a id="NtA_198"
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> although they are not true Nematodes, they have a great
  likeness to the group. He distinguishes them from the swimming members of the group as "creeping
  Nematoda." <i>Chaetosoma</i>, of which two species are known, <i>C. ophicephalum</i> and <i>C.
  claparedii</i>, has a head distinct from the body (Fig. 79). The mouth is at the anterior end,
  surrounded by a double semicircle of movable spicules; the whole body is covered by fine hairs,
  and on the ventral surface, just in front of the anus, is a double row of about fifteen
  cylindrical projections, by whose agency the animal creeps. The female <i>C. claparedii</i> is 1.5
  mm. long, the male 1.14 mm. They were found creeping about on sea-weeds in the neighbourhood of
  Salerno.</p>

  <p><i>Rhabdogaster</i> has no head distinct from the body, though the anterior part of the body is
  swollen. A second swelling occurs, as is also the case with <i>Chaetosoma</i>, in the region of
  the opening of the genital ducts. The female in <i>Rh. cygnoides</i> attains a length of 0.36 mm.
  In this genus the hairs are confined to <span class="pagenum" id="page159"><span
  class="smaller">{159}</span></span>the dorsal middle line. The locomotor projections are hooked,
  and are much finer than those of <i>Chaetosoma</i>, and they are situated farther forward than in
  the last-named genus. <i>Rhabdogaster</i> occurs in the same surroundings as <i>Chaetosoma</i>.
  <i>Ch. ophicephalum</i> is recorded from the English Channel.</p>

  <p>(ii.) <b>Desmoscolecidae.</b>&mdash;The members of this family are minute, and are
  characterised by the presence of well-marked ridges which surround the body and give it an
  appearance of segmentation. The head, which is somewhat swollen, bears four bristles, and single
  pairs are borne by a certain number of the ridges, some on the dorsal and some on the ventral
  surface. These hairs can be moved independently of one another. Two red eye-spots are described
  between the fourth and fifth rings. The sexes are distinct, and the internal organs generally have
  a marked resemblance to those of the true Nematoda. The <i>Desmoscolecidae</i> move by looping
  their bodies after the manner of the Geometrid caterpillars, as well as by creeping with their
  bristles. The genus contains numerous species<a id="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>:
  <i>D. minutus</i> Clap. (English Channel), <i>D. nematoides</i> Greef, <i>D. adelphus</i> Greef,

  <p>Although, considering the enormous number of species of Nematodes and the remarkable diversity
  of the conditions under <span class="pagenum" id="page160"><span
  class="smaller">{160}</span></span>which they live, their bodily structure shows a very striking
  uniformity, the same is by no means the case with their life-history, which exhibits an astounding
  variety. Von Linstow<a id="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> has arranged the various
  modifications, which occur under fourteen heads. He includes in his list the Gordian worms, which
  we have placed under a different heading. The following account has been taken from his paper,
  with a few alterations<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The embryos develop, with a larval stage and without any change of medium, directly into the
  mature sexual forms.  They live in fresh, brackish, or salt water, in plants, in the earth or in
  decaying organic matter: examples, <i>Dorylaimus</i>, <i>Enoplus</i>, <i>Plectus</i>,
  <i>Monhystera</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The larvae live in the earth, the sexual forms in plants: examples, <i>Tylenchus tritici</i>
  and <i>T. devastatrix</i>, <i>Heterodera schachtii</i> (Figs. 77 and 78).</p>

  <p>3. The larvae live in animals, after whose death and decay they are set free and develop into
  the sexual animals in the earth: example, <i>Rhabditis pellio</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The bisexual forms live in the earth, and the fertilised females bore into animals
  (insects), and here produce embryos: example, <i>Sphaerularia bombi</i> (Fig. 76).</p>

  <p>5. The bisexual forms live in the earth; the females do not develop, but the males make their
  way into Insects (Beetles), and becoming hermaphrodite, develop ova which give rise to the
  bisexual form: example, <i>Bradynema rigidum</i>.</p>

  <p>6. The larvae live in the earth, the sexual form in Vertebrates: examples, <i>Dochmius</i>,
  <i>Strongylus</i>.</p>

  <p>7. The Nematode lives as a hermaphrodite in animals, the offspring of this, by an alternation
  of generations, become sexual in the earth: example, <i>Rhabdonema</i> in Frog.</p>

  <p>8. A bisexual free form gives origin to a bisexual parasitic form living in an animal: example,
  <i>Leptodera appendiculata</i> in Snails.</p>

  <p>9. The eggs develop in the earth, and give rise to embryos which are transferred whilst still
  in the egg-cell to the body of an animal. The embryos hatch out and form bisexual parasites:
  examples, <i>Oxyuris</i>, <i>Trichocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>10. The larvae live in insects, the sexual worms in water or in the earth: example,
  <i>Mermis</i>.</p>

  <p>11. The larva lives encapsuled and is passively transferred to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page161"><span class="smaller">{161}</span></span>a second animal: examples, <i>Ollulanus</i>,
  from Mouse to Cat; <i>Cucullanus elegans</i>, from <i>Cyclops</i> to Perch; <i>Spiroptera
  obtusa</i>, from Meal-worm to Mouse.</p>

  <p>12. The sexual form lives for a short time in the intestine of a Vertebrate, and produces
  larvae which bore through the intestinal wall and become encapsuled in the tissues: example,
  <i>Trichina spiralis</i>.</p>

  <p>13. The sexual animal lives in the trachea of birds; the ova containing embryos are coughed up
  and are taken into other birds with food. They quit the egg-shell and wander into the air-sacs,
  and finally into the trachea: example, <i>Syngamus</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">14. There are two larval forms; the first lives in water, the second in the lungs
  of Amphibia, whence they wander into the intestine and become sexually mature: example,
  <i>Nematoxys longicauda</i> in <i>Triton alpestris</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Parasitism.</b></p>

  <p>1. <b>Effect of Parasitism on the Parasite.</b>&mdash;The usual effect of parasitism on the
  parasitic organism is that the various organs necessary for a free life tend to degenerate, whilst
  there is a multiplication and development of organs of adhesion, by means of which the parasite
  maintains its hold on its host. There is further an immense increase in the powers of
  reproduction, which may take the form of an increase in the number of fertilised eggs produced, or
  the parasite may at some time of its life reproduce asexually, by budding, or fission, or
  parthenogetically.</p>

  <p>Of the various classes of animals which are more or less parasitic, the Nematodes show less
  difference between the free-living and parasitic members of the group than obtains in any other
  class. With few exceptions, such as <i>Sphaerularia</i>, <i>Allantonema</i>, and one or two
  others, the parasitic forms have undergone but little degeneration. It is true that they have no
  eyes such as the free forms often possess, but in other respects, such as in the nervous,
  muscular, and digestive systems, they do not show any marked retrogression; further, the
  mouth-armature is developed in many free forms, and is not confined to the parasites.</p>

  <p>The group has developed no methods of asexual reproduction by budding or fission, such as are
  found in Platyhelminthes; and the cases of an alternation of generations in which a sexual form
  alternates with a parthenogenetic form, are rare, <i>e.g.</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page162"><span class="smaller">{162}</span></span><i>Rhabdonema nigrovenosum</i>; and it seems
  possible that even when parthenogenesis has been described, further observation may show that the
  parthenogenetic stage is really a protandrous hermaphrodite, in which case the alternation of
  generations in Nematodes, <i>i.e.</i> the hermaphrodite alternating with the dioecious form, is a
  case of <i>heterogamy</i> or the alternation of two sexual generations.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, parasitic Nematodes produce enormous numbers of eggs. Van Beneden states
  that 60,000,000 have been computed in a single Nematode, and this multiplication of ova is
  absolutely necessary, for the chance of the embryo reaching the right host, in which alone it can
  develop, is always a small one.</p>

  <p>It is a common thing to find that parasites are either hermaphrodite or that the male is
  degenerate, as is the case with many of the parasitic Crustacea, but with one or two exceptions
  the Nematoda are bisexual, and although, as a rule, the males are smaller than the females, they
  show no other trace of degeneracy.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that the class as a whole shows but few special modifications consequent
  on a parasitic mode of life, it is clear that the Nematoda are peculiarly adapted for such a mode
  of life. Their elongated thread-like bodies afford little resistance to the passage of the food,
  which, as it passes through the intestine of the host, might tend to carry the parasites out of
  the body. At the same time their shape enables them to pierce and wriggle through the various
  tissues without making any very serious lesions such as might prove fatal to their host. Their
  extraordinary power of resisting desiccation both in the egg and in the adult state vastly
  increases their chances of ultimately hitting on the right host. They are capable of living in a
  state of suspended animation for months, and even years when dried (<i>vide</i> p. <a
  href="#page136">136</a>), and of resuming their activity on being moistened.</p>

  <p>The great faculty this group shows for living parasitically is evinced by the extraordinary
  variety of life-history presented by the different species. There is scarcely a stage which may
  not be parasitic; the eggs, the larvae, the adults are all in some cases free, in others
  parasitic, and in many cases first the one and then the other.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Occurrence and Effect of the Parasite on the Host.</b>&mdash;Von Linstow states that the
  only law that can be derived inductively from the study of the life-history of Nematodes is that
  those that live in animals never pass through all their stages of development in the same organ;
  consequently, in considering the distribution of <span class="pagenum" id="page163"><span
  class="smaller">{163}</span></span>the parasites within the body of their host we have a double
  habitat to consider. Many forms, such as <i>Trichina spiralis</i>, wander from the intestine to
  the muscles; others, such as <i>Filaria medinensis</i>, from the alimentary canal to the
  lymphatics or blood vessels or subcutaneous tissues. Others pass from the body-cavity to the
  intestine, as the Mermithidae, which infest Insects, or from the stem and leaves of a plant to its
  flower, as in the case of <i>Tylenchus tritici</i>.</p>

  <p>With regard to their occurrence in the different classes of the animal kingdom, they have been
  most frequently observed in Vertebrates and in Insects. They are comparatively rare in the other
  large divisions. Many genera are confined to certain hosts: thus <i>Ascaris</i>, <i>Filaria</i>,
  <i>Trichosoma</i> occur only in Vertebrates; <i>Spiroptera</i> (with one exception) in Mammals and
  Birds; <i>Cucullanus</i> in Fishes and Amphibia; <i>Strongylus</i> and <i>Physaloptera</i> in
  Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles; <i>Dochmius</i>, <i>Pseudalius</i>, <i>Trichocephalus</i> in
  Mammals; <i>Dispharagus</i>, <i>Hystrichis</i>, <i>Syngamus</i> in Birds; <i>Nematoxys</i>,
  <i>Hedruris</i> in Amphibia and Reptiles; <i>Ichthyonema</i> in Fishes; and <i>Isacis</i> and
  <i>Mermis</i> in Insects.</p>

  <p>Twenty-two species have been described as parasitic in man, of which perhaps the most dangerous
  are <i>Filaria medinensis</i>, the three varieties of <i>F. sanguinis hominis</i>; <i>Dochmius</i>
  (<i>Ancylostomum</i>) <i>duodenalis</i>, and <i>Trichina spiralis</i>. The Ascaridae, as
  <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> and <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>, though painful, seldom cause
  death.</p>

  <p>The enormous number of parasites harboured by one host is shown by the fact mentioned in
  Leuckart's <i>Parasites of Man</i>, that Nathusius<a id="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> took from a single black stork 24 specimens of <i>Filaria
  labiata</i> from the lungs, 16 <i>Syngamus trachealis</i> from the trachea, more than 100
  <i>Spiroptera alata</i> from the coats of the stomach, besides several hundred Trematodes
  belonging to several different species (see p. <a href="#page63">63</a>). Even this has been
  surpassed in the case of a young horse, in whose body Krause found 500 <i>Ascaris
  megalocephala</i>, 190 <i>Oxyuris curvula</i>, several millions of <i>Strongylus tetracanthus</i>,
  214 <i>Sclerostomum armatum</i>, 287 <i>Filaria papillosa</i>, 69 <i>Taenia perfoliata</i>, and 6
  <i>Cysticercus</i> forms.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is impossible here to enter into a full description of the destruction caused to
  domesticated animals and crops by the presence of these parasites; full details will be found in
  books dealing <span class="pagenum" id="page164"><span
  class="smaller">{164}</span></span>especially with this question, such as Neumann's <i>Parasites
  and Parasitic Diseases of Domesticated Animals</i>. A couple of cases will show how important this
  matter is to the farmer. Crisp estimates that <i>Syngamus trachealis</i> causes the death of half
  a million pullets in England every year, and M&eacute;gnin states that in a single pheasantry 1200
  victims died daily; again, the loss of one-third the crop of beetroot is by no means uncommon when
  it is infested with <i>Heterodera schachtii</i>. These show the practical importance of what at
  first sight seem quite insignificant animals, and the necessity for the minutest observation, for
  only when we are fully acquainted with all the details of the life-history of a parasite are we in
  a position to successfully combat it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order II. Nematomorpha.</b></p>

  <p>Until the last few years it has been customary to regard the Gordiidae as a family of
  Nematodes. Although in external appearance and life-history they closely resemble the members of
  this group, yet recent research has shown so many important morphological differences between them
  and the Nematoda, that most zoologists are now agreed in placing them in a different sub-Order,
  the Nematomorpha, a name first suggested by Vejdovsky.<a id="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Gordiidae comprise but two genera, <i>Gordius</i> and <i>Nectonema</i>. The latter has but
  one species, <i>N. agile</i> Verr., and is marine; the former, on the other hand, is exclusively
  fresh-water, and contains a very large number of species. Gordian worms are frequently to be found
  in ditches, ponds, or large puddles, moving with an undulating motion through the water, or
  twining and writhing round water-plants; they are scarcer in running water. In shape they are like
  a piece of thin whip-cord, slightly tapering <span class="pagenum" id="page165"><span
  class="smaller">{165}</span></span>at each end; the male, however, is easily distinguished from
  the female by its forked tail (Fig. 89). Not unfrequently a considerable number are found
  inextricably tangled together into a knot, and the name of the genus refers to this fact. Where
  numbers have suddenly appeared in water hitherto free from them, legends have sprung up which
  attribute their presence to a rain of worms; in reality they have come out of the bodies of
  Insects in which they are parasitic for the greater part of their life.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Gordius</i> passes through three distinct stages, of which the first two are
  larval and parasitic; the third is sexually mature and lives in water. The second larval stage
  closely resembles the adult, but the reproductive organs are not developed. The following account
  of the structure of this larval form and of the adult is in the main taken from von Linstow.<a
  id="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The whole body is covered with a well-developed two-layered cuticle, which in the adult is
  marked out into areas, and bears numerous minute sensory bristles, which are especially developed
  in the neighbourhood of the cloaca of the male. Beneath this is a hypodermis which differs
  markedly from the sub-cuticle of Nematodes, inasmuch as it consists of a single layer of polygonal
  nucleated cells. Within this lies a single layer of longitudinal muscle-cells, which differ from
  the corresponding layer of Nematodes in having that part of their medulla which is not surrounded
  by the contractile portion directed outwards towards the hypodermis, and not inwards towards the
  body-cavity.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The body is in the younger stages practically solid, the interior being filled with clearly
  defined polygonal cells which are arranged in definite rows; in later life certain splits arise in
  this tissue which <span class="pagenum" id="page166"><span
  class="smaller">{166}</span></span>subserve various functions; between these splits strands of
  tissue are left which form mesenteries, and some of the cells remain lining the muscular layer
  (Fig. 86). These cells have been described by Vejdovsky as a definite somatic, peritoneal
  epithelium, but this was not found by von Linstow. Besides forming the mesenteries, and acting as
  packing between the various organs of the body, these cells also form the ova and the
  spermatozoa.</p>

  <p>The splits which have appeared when the animal has reached the second larval stage, are two
  dorsal and a ventral; the latter contains the alimentary canal, and may be termed the body-cavity,
  the former will develop the generative organs. The mouth is occluded in the older larvae, and in
  the adults there is a distinct but solid oesophagus which passes into a tubular intestine. The
  intestine consists of a single layer of cells surrounding a lumen; it runs straight to the hinder
  end of the body, where it opens in both sexes with the ducts of the reproductive organs.</p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of a well-defined circumoesophageal ring with two dorsal swellings,
  and, arising from this, a median ventral cord which runs the whole length of the body. The cord
  consists of three longitudinal strands with ganglionic cells below them; the latter, though they
  lie within the muscle layer, maintain a connexion with the hypodermis. Behind, the nerve-cord
  splits in the male, one half passing into each caudal fork. In the adult a pair of black eyes can
  be detected on the head; the only other sense organs are the tactile bristles mentioned above.
  Excretory organs are unknown.</p>

  <p>The generative organs only attain maturity in the adult, which is, in fact, exclusively devoted
  to reproduction. No trace of testes <span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span

  walls of which the spermatozoa will arise are present. They are lined by a definite epithelium
  (Fig. 83), and this serves at once to distinguish them from the body-cavity. Posteriorly the
  splits narrow and become the two vasa deferentia which open one on each side into the cloaca. The
  cells lining the lumen give rise to secondary cells, and these become spermatozoa, the process
  extending from behind forwards. The external organs&mdash;bursa, etc.&mdash;described by Vejdovsky
  were not found by von Linstow.</p>

  <p>In the female larva two similar splits are present; these form the egg-sacs. Posteriorly they
  end in two short oviducts which open into a uterus, in which fertilisation takes place, and in
  which the secretion arises which cements the eggs together. In the adult the ovaries and a
  receptaculum seminis are found, in addition to the organs present in the larva. The ovaries are
  formed from modifications of the packing tissue; they begin close behind the head, and soon attain
  such dimensions as to compress the egg-sacs and body-cavity to small slits. After a time the wall
  between the ovary and the egg-sacs becomes absorbed, and the eggs grow into the latter. In the old
  females, where the egg sacs are empty, there is a considerable space round the exhausted ovary,
  into which eggs continue to fall off; there <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span
  class="smaller">{168}</span></span>is also a median dorsal canal which contains a few eggs. By
  this time the wall between the ovary and the egg-sac has again appeared.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting points about the female is that, according to Vejdovsky, the ovary
  is segmented, the cells which form the ova being heaped up in segmentally-arranged masses. This
  observation, if correct, is almost the only instance of segmentation recorded in the group
  Nemathelminthes.</p>

  <p>The only other genus which is associated with <i>Gordius</i> in the group Nematomorpha is
  <i>Nectonema</i>, of which there is as yet but one species known, <i>Nectonema agile</i> Verr.<a
  id="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> Our knowledge of the anatomy of this worm is due
  mainly to B&uuml;rger<a id="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> and Ward.<a id="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> <i>Nectonema</i> is a marine worm found swimming near the
  surface of the sea with rapid undulatory motion. The males are from 50 to 200 mm. long, the
  females from 30 to 60 mm. The body is faintly ringed, and bears two rows of fine bristles on each
  side. Owing to a curious torsion of the body through a right angle, the lateral bristles of the
  anterior third seem to be placed in the ventral and dorsal middle line. They are very easily
  broken off. The body is divided into a small anterior and a large posterior <span class="pagenum"
  id="page169"><span class="smaller">{169}</span></span>chamber by a transverse septum placed a
  little way behind the head. The anterior chamber contains the brain and is lined by a definite
  epithelium, the posterior is not. The layers of the skin correspond with those of Nematodes or of
  <i>Gordius</i>, but the hypodermal cells show no cell outlines; still they are not so modified as
  in the former group. The hypodermis is thickened in the median dorsal and ventral line, and the
  single nerve-cord lies in the latter.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is degenerate, as in <i>Gordius</i>. A mouth exists, but it is minute, and
  opens into a very fine tube lined with chitin, which pierces through the substance of a single
  elongated cell. This minute oesophagus, with its coextensive cell, reaches back to the transverse
  partition, but behind this a few other cells become associated with it, and ultimately the lumen
  of the alimentary canal is surrounded by four cells; but the number diminishes behind, and soon
  only two cells surround the tube at any one level, and the intestine dwindles away some little
  distance in front of the tail. There is no sign of an anus. A circumoesophageal nerve-ring exists,
  of which the ventral part is by far the larger (Fig. 87); it gives off a ventral nerve-cord, which
  swells posteriorly in the male into a large anal ganglion, far bigger than the brain, and larger
  in the male than in the female.</p>

  <p>The testes consist of a dorsally placed sac, continuous behind with a vas deferens; this opens
  at the posterior end, which is pointed and slightly curved ventrally. The ovary is unknown; but
  females have been found with their body-cavity crammed with ova; these escape, like the
  spermatozoa, from a genital pore at the posterior end of the body.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The separation of the Nematomorpha from the Nematoda depends
  mainly on the character of the nervous system, the absence of the lateral lines and of the dorsal
  line, the character of the contents of the body-cavity, and the character of the reproductive
  organs. In Gordiidae the latter are always placed dorsal to the intestine, and ovaries and testes
  open alike at the hinder end of the body. The importance of the differences in the organs just
  enumerated has been considered sufficient to justify the removal of the Gordiidae from the
  Nematoda, and the establishment of the special sub-Order Nematomorpha for their reception; and
  although <i>Nectonema</i> has a dorsal line, and is in some other respects intermediate between
  the two groups, there can be little doubt that it is more closely allied to <i>Gordius</i> than to
  any member <span class="pagenum" id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span>of the
  Nematoda, and it must therefore be placed with it in the Nematomorpha.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it ought to be mentioned that Camerano<a id="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> found that the chief details of the fertilisation and
  development of the egg in <i>Gordius</i> closely conform with what is known of the same processes
  in Nematodes, and he is of opinion that these resemblances are sufficiently important to justify
  the retention of the group among the Nematoda.</p>

  <p><b>Life-History.</b>&mdash;The life-history of <i>Gordius</i> comprises four stages&mdash;the
  early development of the egg, the first larval form, the second larval form, and the sexually
  mature form. Both larval forms are parasitic, and during their life they are actively engaged in
  feeding; the free form, on the other hand, takes in no nourishment, and is exclusively engaged in
  reproduction.</p>

  <p>Von Linstow<a id="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> gives the following account of
  the life-history of <i>G. tolosanus</i>, a form which has been more fully worked out than any
  other. In the month of April numerous specimens of the beetle <i>Pterostichus niger</i> were found
  floating on the surface of the ditches and small ponds in the fields surrounding G&ouml;ttingen. Some
  were found dead or dying; others appeared quite healthy, and these were swimming actively,
  endeavouring to reach land. Within the abdomen of these beetles, in about 20 per cent of those
  collected, the second larval form of the <i>G. tolosanus</i> was found. The longest larvae were
  122 mm. in length, and very soft, partly snow-white and partly brown in colour; traces of the
  boring apparatus of the first larval form were still to be seen, but in other respects the larva
  only differed from the free form in the immaturity of its sexual organs. Besides the parasite
  hardly anything was to be found in the abdomen of the beetle, the larva having eaten up all trace
  of the fat body and the generative organs of its host. The larvae bored their way out of the body
  of the beetle and became adult animals.</p>

  <p>It is rather difficult to say what brings these essentially <span class="pagenum"
  id="page171"><span class="smaller">{171}</span></span>terrestrial beetles to the water, but von
  Linstow suggests that, as they live partly on snails, and at this time of year there are not many
  land-snails about, they may be in search of water-snails such as <i>Limnaea</i>. They may also be
  sometimes blown into the water by wind storms, but, whatever the cause is, their presence in water
  is essential for the continuance of the life of their parasites.</p>

  <p>Once free in the water the <i>Gordius</i> is soon sexually mature; the fertilisation takes
  place in April, and then the female may be seen twisting and writhing round the stems of
  water-plants and laying the long bead-like strands of eggs (Fig. 82). The first deposition
  observed by von Linstow took place on 14th April, the last on 2nd August, and the period of
  egg-laying for each female extended over four weeks. At first the eggs are snow-white, but within
  twenty-four hours they turn brown in colour.</p>

  <p>The development of the first larva within the egg takes about a month. When it emerges from the
  egg-shell it is minute, .065 mm. long, ringed anteriorly, and provided with a protrusible and
  retractile boring apparatus consisting of three chitinous rods; round the base of this piercing
  proboscis is a double crown of papillae, each bearing a spine (Fig. 90).</p>

  <p>This first larval form breaks through the egg-shell and sinks to the bottom of the water, where
  it moves about sluggishly and awaits the arrival of the right host in which to take up its abode.
  This host is the larva of the Alder-fly, <i>Sialis lutaria</i> Lin. (<i>vide</i> vol. v. p. 444),
  and into this it bores and comes to rest in the muscles or the fat body. It does not form distinct
  capsules. It remains in this larva during the following winter, and in the spring passes over into
  the imago <i>Sialis</i>. The complete insect frequents the small plants growing along the water's
  edge, and falls an easy prey to the predaceous beetle <i>Pt. niger</i>. The larva is eaten, and
  undergoing a change becomes the second larval form mentioned above. It remains in the body of the
  beetle during the second winter, and finally returns to the water <span class="pagenum"
  id="page172"><span class="smaller">{172}</span></span>as the adult some eighteen or twenty months
  after it has been hatched from the egg.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>From the above account of the life-history of <i>Gordius</i> it will be seen that the chances
  of an egg reaching maturity are comparatively small, and to compensate for this a very large
  number of eggs are laid. In addition to the risk of the larvae not finding the right host at the
  right time, and of the first host not being eaten by the second, and the second not being drowned,
  there is the danger that the ditches and ponds in which the adults live may dry up, and, in fact,
  great numbers of worms perish by this taking place.</p>

  <p>The sex of the adults may be told from their colour, the males being of a blackish brown, the
  females of a light clay brown; the former average 120 mm. in length, the latter 170 mm. The males
  are also more numerous, the proportion being seven to three. Camerano<a id="NtA_213"
  href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> has drawn attention to the fact that there is a certain
  polymorphism in size, form, and colour which is especially common amongst the males; dwarf forms
  with mature reproductive organs exist, and he is of opinion that these differences depend both on
  the size of the second host and on the duration of the parasitic life.</p>

  <p>In addition to the larva of <i>Sialis lutaria</i>, the first larval stage has also been found
  in the larva of <i>Ephemera</i>, <i>Tanypus</i>, <i>Corethra</i>, and <i>Chironomus</i>; the
  second in <i>Carabus hortensis</i> Fabr., <i>Procerus</i> (<i>Carabus</i>) <i>coriaceus</i> Linn.,
  <i>Calathus fuscipes</i> Goeze, <i>Molops elatus</i> Fabr., several species of
  <i>Pterostichus</i>, and a number of other beetles. It is probable that its normal hosts are <i>S.
  lutaria</i> and <i>Pt. niger</i>, but it is clear that it often comes to rest in other insects.
  The view that the Gordiidae have no special hosts, but may either pass the whole of their
  life-history within one and the same animal, or, on the other hand, may inhabit animals belonging
  to very different groups, is held by Villot, who has paid great attention to the subject. He finds
  the first larval form encysted in the walls of the alimentary canal in fishes, such <span
  class="pagenum" id="page173"><span class="smaller">{173}</span></span>as <i>Leuciscus
  phoxinus</i>, the minnow, <i>Cobitis barbatula</i>, the loach, and <i>Petromyzon planeri</i>, the
  lamprey; in the larvae of Diptera, <i>Ephemera</i>, and beetles, in <i>Planorbis</i> (a water
  snail), in <i>Enchytraeus</i> (an Oligochaet); the second larval form in all kinds of insects,
  spiders, Crustacea, fish, frogs, birds (<i>Otis</i>), and in man, and these various habitats lead
  him to the conclusion that "Les Gordiens n'ont pas d'h&ocirc;tes sp&eacute;ciaux." On the other hand, as von
  Linstow points out, it is contrary to our knowledge of parasites that a single species should
  develop equally well in the body of warm and cold-blooded Vertebrates and of Insects, and the
  explanation of the presence of the larvae in these various forms may either be that they belong to
  different species of <i>Gordius</i> or, more probably, that they are accidentally present, having
  passed into their hosts with drinking water.</p>

  <p>The number of species of <i>Gordius</i> is large; over 100 are enumerated in the <i>Compendium
  der Helminthologie</i>,<a id="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> the great majority of
  which inhabit insects.</p>

  <p>The life-history of <i>Nectonema</i> is practically unknown; the adults have been found
  swimming near the surface of the sea at two places only: Newport, R.I., and Wood's Holl, Mass., on
  the south coast of New England. It has been fished close to the shore, from the end of June to the
  beginning of October, when the tide is going out at evening and there is no moon. This seems to
  indicate that it avoids the light. When first caught the worms move actively about, coiling
  themselves into figures of eight and then uncoiling; at the same time there is a rhythmical
  movement caused by waves of muscular contraction passing down each side of the body alternately;
  by this kind of motion they make rapid and definite progress through the water.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It seems probable that the adult <i>Nectonema</i> is preceded by one or more larval
  stages, and what appears to be a young form has <span class="pagenum" id="page174"><span
  class="smaller">{174}</span></span>been obtained from the thoracic cavity of a prawn,
  <i>Palaemonetes</i>,<a id="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> which has thus some claim
  to be regarded as the host of this species, but nothing is known about its early life-history.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order III. Acanthocephala.</b></p>

  <p>The Acanthocephala, which form the third class of the Nemathelminthes, consists of but few
  genera; there are, however, numerous species of very different size, varying from 10 to 65 cm.
  long in the female <i>Gigantorhynchus</i> (<i>Echinorhynchus</i>) <i>gigas</i>, to quite minute
  forms a few millimetres in length. The adult stage occurs in the alimentary canal of Vertebrates,
  as a rule in those which live in, or frequent water; the larvae are found in the bodies of certain
  Invertebrates, very frequently small Crustacea.</p>

      Pike. Magnified with a lens. (From Hamann.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The body of the mature forms can usually be divided into three
  sections&mdash;the proboscis, the neck, and the trunk, but the middle region is not always
  discernible. The proboscis is armed with rings of hooks (Fig. 93) arranged in longitudinal rows;
  they are usually of two kinds, but in <i>E. proteus</i> of three. They have a certain specific
  value, but not much stress can be laid on the number of rings, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>E. angustatus</i>
  the number varies from eight to twenty-four. The recurved hooks serve to fasten the parasite very
  firmly to the tissues of the host. The proboscis is hollow and retractile; it can be withdrawn
  into the body by means of muscles attached internally to its tip. It does not, however, pass
  straight into the body-cavity, but is retracted into a special cavity&mdash;the proboscis
  sheath&mdash;with a double muscular wall. The proboscis sheath may perhaps be looked upon as a
  septum, such as is found in some of the Nematomorpha, dividing the body-cavity into two parts. It
  is inserted into the body-wall at the junction of the neck and trunk or of the proboscis and
  trunk. In addition to the muscles which withdraw the proboscis into its sheath, there are two
  retractors running from the <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span
  class="smaller">{175}</span></span>outside of the sheath to the body-wall; these serve to retract
  the whole sheath and its contents into the body-cavity of the trunk.</p>

  <p>The structure of the skin is essentially like that of Nematodes, but the details are much more
  complicated. The whole body is covered by a thin cuticle secreted by the epidermis, which, as in
  the other groups, breaks down and forms a syncytium called the sub-cuticle. The minute fibrils
  which penetrate this layer are much more definitely arranged than in Nematodes; the largest of
  them run from without inwards, others run concentrically round the body. Large oval or spherical
  nuclei are scattered in the sub-cuticle, which is further honeycombed by a number of lacunae or
  spaces which are described below.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Within the sub-cuticular layer is found a sheath of circularly-arranged muscle-fibres, and
  within this again a sheath of longitudinal muscles which do not extend into the proboscis; this
  inner layer lines the body-cavity, there being no epithelium within it. In their minute structure
  the muscle-cells resemble those of Nematodes.</p>

  <p>The canals in the sub-cuticle form a very curious system of anastomosing spaces, in which a
  clear fluid containing fat globules circulates. The extent to which the system is developed varies
  in different species, but in all there is a pair of longitudinal canals which are situated
  laterally, and which give off the subsidiary channels in their course. The above description
  applies to the lacunar spaces in the skin of the trunk; those of the proboscis are quite distinct,
  and there is no communication between the two sets of spaces; in fact, the sub-cuticle in which
  the lacunae are formed is not continuous across the line of junction of the proboscis and the
  neck, or, when the latter is absent, of the proboscis and the trunk, but it is interrupted by the
  ingrowth of a thin ring of cuticle which reaches down to the muscular layers (Fig. 94).</p>

      the proboscis with the lemnisci.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>All the spaces in the skin of the proboscis open ultimately into a circular canal situated
  round its base; on each side the canal opens into a sac-like structure which extends through the
  body-cavity towards the posterior end of the animal. These two lateral diverticula are termed the
  <i>lemnisci</i>. They have always attracted considerable attention from the workers at the group,
  and numerous functions have from time to time been attributed to them. They are more or less
  hollow, and their walls consist of sub-cuticular tissue surrounded with a scanty muscular coat;
  they contain the same fluid as the lacunae of the skin of the proboscis, with which they are
  placed in communication by means of the circular canal; and it seems most probable that, as
  Hamann<a id="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> suggests, they act as reservoirs into
  which the lacunar fluid retires when the proboscis is retracted, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page177"><span class="smaller">{177}</span></span>and which, by means of the contractions of
  their muscular coat, force the fluid into the lacunae when the proboscis is everted, and thus aid
  in its protrusion.</p>

  <p>The parasitic habits of <i>Echinorhynchus</i> have had a deeper influence on the structure of
  the body than is the case with the Nematoda. All traces of an alimentary canal have disappeared,
  and the animals live entirely by the imbibition through the skin of the already elaborated fluids
  of their hosts. The power of absorbing fluids is shown by the fact that they swell up and become
  tense when placed in fresh water.</p>

  <p>Until recently no definite excretory organs had been recognised, and the function of excreting
  the nitrogenous matter was by some assigned to the lemnisci. In 1893 Kaiser<a id="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> described in <i>G. gigas</i> two organs which he called
  nephridia, placed dorsally to the ducts of the male and female reproductive organs. Each
  nephridium, which somewhat resembles a cauliflower, consists of a stalk or duct, opening at one
  end into the reproductive ducts, and at the other branching and breaking up into a number of
  secondary and tertiary twigs. The end of each twig is closed by a membrane pierced with a number
  of most minute pores, by means of which it communicates with the body-cavity; on the inner side
  the membrane bears a number of long cilia, which keep up an active flickering. The presence of
  these cilia is interesting, as elsewhere they are unknown throughout the Nemathelminthes.</p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of a central ganglion situated in the proboscis sheath; it is oval
  and flattened in shape. The ganglion gives off nerves to the proboscis, and two main trunks which
  pierce the proboscis-sheath and run backward surrounded by a cluster of muscle-fibres, the whole
  being termed the <span class="pagenum" id="page178"><span
  class="smaller">{178}</span></span><i>retinaculum</i>; in the male they are in connexion with a
  special genital ganglion which lies near the ductus ejaculatorius.</p>

  <p>With the exception of certain sensory papillae in the neighbourhood of the male genital
  orifice, and of three similar papillae mentioned by Kaiser on the proboscis, the Acanthocephala
  are devoid of sense organs.</p>

  <p>The Acanthocephala are dioecious; their generative organs are developed in connexion with the
  <i>ligament</i>, a cord-like structure which arises between the inner and outer layer of the
  hinder end of the proboscis sheath and traverses the body-cavity, ending posteriorly in connexion
  with the genital ducts. The testes lie in this ligament; they are paired oval bodies which open
  each into a vas deferens. The vasa deferentia each bear three lateral diverticula, the vesiculae
  seminales; and three pairs of cement glands pour their secretion into a duct which opens into the
  vasa deferentia; the latter unite and open by a penis which is withdrawn into a genital bursa, but
  is capable of being extruded.</p>

  <p>The two ovaries are formed in the ligament of the female in a corresponding position to that
  occupied by the testes in the male, but at an early stage they break down into packets of cells,
  of which those of the peripheral layer develop into ova at the cost of the central cells, which
  serve them as a food supply. As these masses grow and increase in number they rupture the walls of
  the ligament, and escape into the body-cavity, in which they float. The ova are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span>fertilised whilst floating
  in the fluid of the body-cavity. The eggs segment and the embryo is formed whilst still in the
  body of the mother.</p>

  <p>The embryos escape by means of a complicated apparatus the details of which vary in the
  different species, but which, like many of the organs in these animals, consists of very few cells
  with very large nuclei. This apparatus consists of three parts: the bell, the uterus, and the
  oviduct. The bell is a large funnel-shaped structure, which opens into the body-cavity, and is
  connected with the end of the ligament; near its lower end, where it is continuous with the
  uterus, is a second smaller opening situated dorsally. By the contraction and expansion of its
  lips the oval embryos are swallowed and pass on through the uterus to the oviduct, which opens at
  the posterior end of the body. If the bell takes in any of the less mature eggs which are
  spherical in shape, they are passed back into the body-cavity through the above-mentioned dorsal
  opening, and the same orifice permits the passage of the spermatozoa even when the bell is full of
  embryos.</p>

  <p><b>Embryology.</b>&mdash;After fertilisation the egg surrounds itself with several egg-shells,
  three of which are usually distinguished; the embryo is already far advanced in its development by
  the time it leaves the body of the mother and passes out into the alimentary canal of the
  Vertebrate host. It leaves the body of this second host with the faeces, and is eaten by the first
  or larval host, usually a small Crustacean or water-insect, but in some cases a fish, within whose
  alimentary canal it casts its membranes and <span class="pagenum" id="page180"><span
  class="smaller">{180}</span></span>becomes actively mobile. By means of a ring of hooks developed
  round the anterior end it bores its way through the wall of the alimentary canal, and after some
  time&mdash;three weeks in <i>E. proteus</i>&mdash;comes to rest in the body-cavity of its host. By
  this time most of the organs of the adult, with the exception of the reproductive glands, are
  already well established; the latter only attain maturity when the first host is eaten by the
  second, and the larvae find themselves in the intestine of a Vertebrate.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some of the details of the development are very remarkable, and a short account of them may be
  given. The segmentation of the egg is unequal; it results in the formation of a central
  biscuit-shaped mass of small cells and a peripheral mass of larger cells; the former is called by
  Hamann<a id="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> the entoblast, the latter the ectoblast.
  From the entoblast arise all the organs of the body but the sub-cuticle and the associated
  lemnisci, which are formed from the ectoblast. The latter has a remarkable history; the cells
  begin to break down and lose their outlines, whilst their nuclei fuse together and form a small
  number of giant nuclei, which lie scattered throughout the syncytium thus formed. The syncytium
  surrounds the entoblast on all sides; by this time the anteriorly-placed hooks have appeared; in
  <i>E. proteus</i> there <span class="pagenum" id="page181"><span
  class="smaller">{181}</span></span>are ten of these, but the number is not the same in all
  species. The syncytium is in a fluid state, with a few gigantic nuclei floating in it; these now
  lose their spherical shape, and throwing out processes become amoeboid; in this way they bud off
  small portions of their substance, and from these the oval nuclei of the sub-cuticle and the
  lemnisci arise. The rest of the syncytium hardens into the fibrillar matrix of the sub-cuticle,
  leaving, however, scattered spaces which form the sub-cuticular sinuses of the adult. An
  interesting feature of <i>N. clavaeceps</i> and <i>Arhynchus hemignathi</i> is that the skin of
  the adult retains the larval features, and it and the lemnisci consist of a syncytium with a very
  few giant nuclei scattered through it. Hamann counted only eight in the skin and two in each
  lemniscus in the example figured on p. <a href="#page178">178</a>.</p>

  <p>The whole of the rest of the body is formed by the entoblast. Within the latter a circular
  split arises which separates a single layer of outermost cells from an axial strand of many cells
  (Fig. 98, B). The split is the future body-cavity; the axial strand forms the proboscis, its
  sheath, the cerebral ganglion, muscles, etc., and the ligament with the contained generative
  organs; the outermost layer of cells forms the muscular lining to the skin. It is interesting to
  note that these cells destined to become muscle-fibres are at first arranged as a single layer of
  cubical epithelial cells lining the body-cavity; most of them become circular muscle-fibres, but a
  few are pushed inwards so as to lie next the body-cavity, and these become the longitudinal
  fibres.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;Until recently the Acanthocephala were supposed to include but one
  genus, <i>Echinorhynchus</i>, with several hundred species, but Hamann<a id="NtA_219"
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> has pointed out that these species <span class="pagenum"
  id="page182"><span class="smaller">{182}</span></span>present differences which enabled him to
  divide the group into three families, each with a corresponding genus. To these I have ventured to
  add a fourth family, to include a remarkable species, <i>Arhynchus hemignathi</i>, described
  below. The characters of the first three families in the account given below are taken from
  Hamann's paper.</p>

  <p><b>Family I. Echinorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;The body is elongated and smooth. The proboscis-sheath
  has a double wall, and the proboscis is invaginated into it. The central nerve-ganglion lies in
  the middle line, as a rule on the posterior blind end of the proboscis-sheath. The papillae which
  bear the hooks are only covered with a chitinous cap at their apex, and the hooks have a process
  below. This family is by far the largest; a few species only can be mentioned. <i>Echinorhynchus
  proteus</i> lives in its mature form in fishes; the young forms, up to a centimetre in length, are
  found living freely in the intestine of numerous fresh-water fishes. Those found in <i>Gobio
  fluviatilis</i>, the gudgeon; <i>Leuciscus virgo</i>; <i>Lota vulgaris</i>, the burbot or
  eel-pout; young trout; <i>Thymallus vulgaris</i>, the grayling, seldom surpass this size, but
  those found in <i>Acerina cernua</i>, the pope fish; in <i>Abramis bipunctatus</i>; in <i>Esox
  lucius</i>,the pike, and in older trout, attain or surpass double the length. As the parasites
  grow older they bury their proboscis and neck in the wall of the intestine, the inner surface of
  which is studded with the orange-coloured bodies of the parasites. The proboscis is so deeply sunk
  in the wall of the alimentary canal as to form a papilla on its outer surface (Fig. 92). The
  larvae of <i>E. proteus</i> are found in the body-cavity of <i>Gammarus pulex</i>, one of the
  Amphipod Crustacea, and also in the same position in numerous fresh-water fishes; they must have
  passed into this first host by the <span class="pagenum" id="page183"><span
  class="smaller">{183}</span></span>mouth and alimentary canal. If the liver of an infested minnow,
  <i>Leuciscus phoxinus</i>, be examined, it will be found to contain on its surface numerous
  spherical or egg-shaped capsules of an orange colour, 2 to 2.5 mm. in length; these contain the
  larval forms of the parasite. They develop into the adult form when the first host is eaten by a
  carnivorous fish, but a complication may take place when the larval form is found in
  <i>Gammarus</i>, as the latter, the first host, may be eaten by a fish (intermediate host) in
  which the larva does not become mature, and only develops sexual organs when eaten by a
  carnivorous fish (second host). The larval form is also found in <i>Nemachilus barbatulus</i>,
  <i>Gobio fluviatilis</i>, and the sticklebacks <i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i> and <i>G.
  pungitius</i>.</p>

  <p><i>E. clavula</i> Duj. is found in <i>Salmo fario</i>, <i>Abramis brama</i>, <i>Cyprinus
  carpio</i>, <i>Gobius niger</i>, <i>Lepadogaster gouanii</i>, etc.; <i>E. linstowi</i> Ham. in
  <i>Leuciscus idus</i>, <i>Abramis ballerus</i>, <i>Abramis bipunctatus</i>, and <i>Acipenser
  huso</i>; <i>E. lutzii</i> Ham. was found by Dr. Lutz in Brazil in the intestine of <i>Bufo
  agua</i>; <i>E. angustatus</i> Rud. occurs in such numbers in the perch, <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>,
  as to almost occlude the lumen of the intestine, and one out of every three or four fish in
  certain districts is infested by it. It is also found in the pike, <i>Esox lucius</i>, and the
  barbel, <i>Barbus vulgaris</i>. The first or larval host of this species is the Isopod <i>Asellus
  aquaticus</i>. <i>E. moniliformis</i> Brews. is stated to attain maturity in the human intestine.
  Except for the fact that <i>G. gigas</i> has once been observed in the same place, this is the
  only human parasite amongst the Acanthocephala. Its normal second hosts are <i>Mus decumanus</i>
  and <i>Myoxus quercinus</i>, and its first or larval host, the larvae of the beetle <i>Blaps
  mucronata</i>. <i>E. porrigens</i> Rud. is found in considerable numbers in the small intestine of
  a fin-whale (<i>Balaenoptera sibbaldii</i>), and <i>E. strumosus</i> Rud., in the small intestine
  of a seal (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>), and in the body-cavity of the angler fish (<i>Lophius
  piscatorius</i>). <i>E. acus</i> is common in the whiting, <i>Gadus merlangus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Family II. Gigantorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;Large forms with ringed, flattened, and
  <i>Taenia</i>-like bodies. The hook-papillae are covered all over with transparent chitinous
  sheaths with two root-like processes. The proboscis-sheath is muscular and without a lumen. The
  central nervous system is excentrically placed below the middle of the so-called sheath. The
  lemnisci are long twisted tubes with a central canal.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page184"><span class="smaller">{184}</span></span></div>

  <p>Hamann places three species in this family: <i>Gigantorhynchus echinodiscus</i>, <i>G.
  spira</i>, and <i>G. taenioides</i>; but as he points out that <i>E. gigas</i> resembles these in
  its more important structural features, it seems advisable to include it here under the name <i>G.
  gigas</i>. The members of the first family often present a transversely ringed appearance after
  death, but the Gigantorhynchidae are ringed when alive, and the circular canals in the skin show a
  certain regularity, being arranged one between each two rings. There is no lumen in the
  proboscis-sheath, which is not attached to the boundary between the proboscis and the trunk, but
  to the inner surface of the proboscis, and the whole can be retracted within the anterior portion
  of the body, which is invaginable. There are always eight cement-glands, and other differences
  exist in the musculature, hooks, and position of the nervous system.</p>

  <p><i>G. gigas</i> occurs in the adult state in the small intestine of swine; in Europe its first
  or larval host is believed to be the grubs of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i> and <i>Cetonia
  aurata</i>, but these beetles are absent from America, though the parasite infests American hogs.
  Stiles<a id="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> has recently made some experiments which
  tend to show that in the United States the source of infection is some species of the beetle
  <i>Lachnosterna</i>, and he has succeeded in infecting the grub of <i>L. arcuata</i> by feeding it
  on the eggs of the parasite; from one larva he took 300 parasites six weeks after feeding it.
  <i>L. arcuata</i> is, like <i>M. vulgaris</i>, phytophagous, but the grubs of both the beetles are
  fond of frequenting manure heaps and patches of dung, and thus are much exposed to the dangers of
  infection.</p>

  <p><i>G. echinodiscus</i> inhabits the intestine of ant-eaters, having been found in
  <i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i> and <i>Cycloturus didactylus</i>. <i>G. spira</i> lives in the king
  vulture <i>Sarcorhampus papa</i>, and <i>G. taenioides</i> in <i>Dicholophus cristatus</i>, a
  species of Cariama.</p>

  <p><b>Family III. Neorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;Sexual maturity is reached in the larval stage. The
  proboscis-sheath has a single wall. A few giant nuclei only are found in the sub-cuticle and in
  the lemnisci. The circular muscle layer is very simply developed. The longitudinal muscle-cells
  are only present in certain places.</p>

  <p>This family includes two species, <i>Neorhynchus clavaeceps</i> and <i>N. agilis</i>, which
  afford interesting examples of paedogenesis. The sub-cuticle and the lemnisci are dominated by a
  few giant <span class="pagenum" id="page185"><span class="smaller">{185}</span></span>nuclei,
  which remain in the embryonic state and do not break up into numerous nuclei as in other forms.
  The musculature is but little developed and the longitudinal sheath hardly exists. The
  proboscis-sheath consists of a simple muscular layer, and the short proboscis has few hooks and
  presents an embryonic appearance.</p>

  <p>The sexually-mature form lives in the carp, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>; the larval form is found,
  according to Villot,<a id="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> encysted in the fat bodies
  of the larva of <i>Sialis lutaria</i>, one of the Neuroptera, and in the alimentary canal of the
  leech <i>Nephelis octocula</i>, and successful experiments have been made in infecting some
  species of the water snail <i>Limnaea</i>. <i>N. agilis</i> occurs in <i>Mugil auratus</i> and
  <i>M. cephalus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Family IV. Arhynchidae.</b>&mdash;Short forms with the body divided into three well-marked
  regions&mdash;head, collar, and trunk. The head is pitted, the collar smooth, and the trunk
  wrinkled, not annulated, in spirit specimens. There is no eversible introvert, and no introvert
  sheath and no hooks. The sub-cuticle and the lemnisci have a few giant nuclei, and the lemnisci
  are long and coiled.<a id="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This family resembles the Gigantorhynchidae in the length and curvature of its lemnisci, and
  the Neorhynchidae in the persistence of the embryonic condition of the nuclei in the sub-cuticle
  and the lemnisci; but in the shape of the body, its division into three well-marked regions, the
  absence of eversible proboscis, proboscis sheath, and hooks it stands alone, though it is nearer
  to the Neorhynchidae than to either of the other families.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The single species <i>Arhynchus hemignathi</i> was found attached to the skin
  around the anus of a Sandwich Island bird, <i>Hemignathus proceros</i>. The bird is a member of a
  family Drepanididae, which is entirely confined to the Sandwich Island group. Professor Newton
  tells me that it is probable that the "food of <i>Hemignathus</i> consists entirely of insects
  which it finds in or under the bark of trees," hence it is probable that the second host of this
  parasite, if such exists, must be looked for amongst the Insecta.</p>

  <p>At certain seasons and at certain times of the day the naturalist who is investigating the
  fauna of the surface of the sea is apt to find his tow-net crammed with innumerable transparent
  spindle-shaped animals, which by their number and the way in which they become entangled with
  rarer objects, often render useless the result of his labours. These animals belong to the class
  Chaetognatha, which includes three genera, <i>Sagitta</i>, <i>Spadella</i>, and <i>Krohnia</i>.
  Amongst them are divided about twenty species, some of which, however, are of doubtful value.</p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The body of these animals is as transparent as crystal; it is elongated,
  and bears a resemblance to certain torpedos, except that the head forms a somewhat blunt
  termination to the spindle-shaped body. The tail bears a caudal fin, and <i>Spadella</i> and
  <i>Krohnia</i> have a single pair, and <i>Sagitta</i> two pairs, of lateral fins; all of which are
  flattened horizontally.</p>

  <p>The body is externally divisible into three regions&mdash;head, trunk, and tail&mdash;and these
  correspond with the arrangement of the internal organs.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;<i>Sagitta bipunctata.</i> <i>a</i>,
      Vesicula seminalis. &times; 4. (After Hertwig.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The head is surrounded by a fold of skin, forming a hood, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page187"><span class="smaller">{187}</span></span>which is most prominent at the sides (Fig.
  102, <i>g</i>); within the hood the head bears from two to four rows of short spines, and outside
  these a right and left row of sickle-shaped hooks, the free ends of which in a state of rest
  converge round the mouth, but when disturbed these hooks can be widely divaricated.</p>

  <p>The cavity of the body, or coelom, is divided into three distinct chambers by the presence of
  two thin transverse walls or septa, one situated between the head and the trunk, the other between
  the trunk and the tail (Figs. 104, 105). In the head, this cavity is much reduced by the presence
  of special muscles which move the spines, hooks, etc.; and in the small species, such as
  <i>Spadella cephaloptera</i>, the other two cavities are almost entirely occupied by the digestive
  and reproductive organs<a id="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>; but in the large
  species, e.g. <i>Sagitta hexaptera</i>, a considerable space is left between the internal organs
  and the skin, and this is occupied by a coelomic fluid. If the skin of one of these larger species
  be punctured the fluid escapes and the animal shrivels up. A longitudinal partition or mesentery,
  with numerous pores in it, runs through these spaces, dividing the body-cavity into a right and
  left half; in the region of the trunk this mesentery supports the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>In addition to certain muscles in the head, which move the hooks, etc., there is a muscular
  lining to the body-wall. This is divided into two dorsal and two ventral bands, much in the same
  way as in Nematodes. The muscle fibres are striated.</p>

  <p>The mouth, situated either terminally&mdash;<i>Spadella marioni</i><a id="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a>&mdash;or below the head, leads into a pharynx; this passes
  into an intestine lined by a single layer of ciliated cells with a few glandular ones
  intermingled. The intestine runs straight through the body without loop or coil, and opens by an
  anus situated at the junction of the trunk and the tail. In most cases the anus is ventral or on
  the lower surface, but Gourret asserts that in <i>Spadella marioni</i> it is on the upper
  surface.</p>

  <p>There are no special respiratory, excretory, or circulatory organs, unless a glandular
  structure described by Gourret in the head of <i>Spadella marioni</i> be a real kidney.</p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of a supra-oesophageal ganglion <span class="pagenum"
  id="page188"><span class="smaller">{188}</span></span>or brain situated in the head, and of a
  ventral ganglion lying in the trunk; both these nerve centres are embedded in the epidermis, and
  are connected with one another by means of two stout peri-oesophageal nerves (Figs. 102, 104). The
  brain also gives off a pair of nerves to the eyes, another pair to the olfactory organ, and a pair
  which ultimately meet one another and so form a ring; on this are certain ganglia giving off
  nerves which supply the muscles of the head. Both the chief ganglia give off numerous nerves,
  which divide and split up into a network of fibres which permeate the whole skin.</p>

  <p>The sense organs are comparatively simple. A pair of very small eyes lie in the skin of the
  head; they are of complex structure, and to some extent remind one of the simple eyes of certain
  Crustacea. Behind the eyes and also on the upper surface of the animal is an unpaired organ which
  is usually described as olfactory in function (Figs. 103, 105). This is a ring-shaped modification
  of the epidermis drawn out into different shapes in the various species. The modified epidermal
  cells bear long cilia. The remaining sensory organs found in the group consist of clumps of
  modified cells scattered in round groups over the surface of the body and of the fins. The central
  cells of each group bear long tactile hairs, and are surrounded by supporting cells.</p>

  <p>The Chaetognatha are hermaphrodite, and carry the female organs in the trunk, the male in the
  tail. In a mature specimen the two ovaries occupy almost all the space in the trunk between the
  alimentary canal and the skin, and each is supported by a narrow lateral mesentery. The ovary is
  traversed by a oviduct which often contains spermatozoa; it is not clear how the eggs make their
  way into the oviduct, which seems to have <span class="pagenum" id="page189"><span
  class="smaller">{189}</span></span>no internal opening and to act largely as a receptaculum
  seminis. The oviducts open externally on the upper side at the base of the lateral fin, close to
  the junction of the tail and the trunk.</p>

  <p>The cavity of the tail is divided into two lateral chambers by the extension backward of the
  median vertical mesentery. In each of these a testis and a vas deferens are found. The testes are
  solid ridges formed by the growth of the lining cells of this part of the body-cavity; the cells
  mature into spermatozoa, which break off and float freely in the coelomic fluid. At the breeding
  season the whole tail may be crowded with masses of spermatozoa, which are kept in a more or less
  regular circulation by the ciliated cells lining the body-wall. The vas deferens opens internally
  into the space where the spermatozoa lie, and at the other end into a vesicula seminis, which
  opens to the exterior. The position of the latter structure varies, and is of some systematic
  value.</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid in the water and as a rule float at the surface of the sea. <i>Spadella
  cephaloptera</i> is, however, an exception to this rule, as it attaches its eggs by means of a
  gelatinous stalk to sea-weeds. The segmentation of the ovum is regular, and gives rise to a
  two-layered stage or <i>gastrula</i>, which opens by a pore, the <i>blastopore</i>. This does not,
  however, become the mouth, but closes up and the mouth arises at the opposite pole. Perhaps the
  most interesting feature of the development of <i>Sagitta</i> is that the cells destined to form
  the reproductive organs separate from the other cells of the embryo at a very early date, whilst
  it is still in the gastrula stage. There is no larval form, but the young hatch out from the egg
  in a state resembling the adult in all respects but that of size.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Chaetognatha are essentially pelagic, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>resemble many other creatures that dwell at
  the surface of the ocean in being almost completely transparent. Most species have been taken far
  out at sea, but some are perhaps rather more numerous near the coast, and one species, <i>Spadella
  cephaloptera</i>, is littoral. They swim by means of muscular movements of the whole body; the
  fins have no movement of their own, and seem to serve as balancers, and not as locomotory organs.
  Although usually found at the surface of the water, many species have been taken at considerable
  depths. Chun<a id="NtA_225" href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> states that they are found in
  countless numbers at depths of from 100 metres to 1300 metres. The commonest species at these
  depths are <i>Sagitta hexaptera</i> and <i>Sagitta serratodentata</i>. <i>Sagitta bipunctata</i>,
  according to the same authority, confines itself to the surface. Whether the change of depth is
  diurnal, or whether it has any relation to sexual maturity, or to any other cause, has not been
  satisfactorily determined.</p>

  <p>The food of the Chaetognatha consists of floating diatoms, Infusoria, small larvae, and such
  Copepods as <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>, and small Amphipods as <i>Phoxus plumosus</i>.<a
  id="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> At times they also devour small larval or
  post-larval fishes, and owing to their incredible numbers, they doubtless do considerable damage
  to sea fisheries. It is also recorded that they eat one another, and specimens have been taken
  which have ingested the whole body of another <i>Sagitta</i> except the head, which hangs out of
  the mouth of the eater, and gives it the appearance of a double-headed monster.<a id="NtA_227"
  href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> It has been said that they attack hydroid polypes, but here at
  any rate they do not have it all their own way. Masterman<a id="NtA_228"
  href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> has figured the apical group of five polypes of <i>Obelia</i>,
  three of which are engaged in ingesting as many young <i>Sagitta</i>.</p>

  <p>They exist in incredible numbers; Grassi describes the surface of the sea at Messina on certain
  days as being literally covered with them, and they must form the food supply of numerous animals
  which prey upon the pelagic fauna. The immense number of individuals is probably accounted for to
  some extent by the fact that they lay eggs all the year round, and pass <span class="pagenum"
  id="page191"><span class="smaller">{191}</span></span>through a very short and rapid development.
  They are not known to be phosphorescent.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The features of the Chaetognatha which have most systematic value
  are the size of the adult, the relations of the length to the breadth, and of the three divisions
  to one another; the size, number, and position of the lateral fins, and of the hooks and spines on
  the head; the thickness of the epidermis, and the structure of the olfactory organ; and, finally,
  the form of the reproductive organs.</p>

  <p>Strodtmann,<a id="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> who gives the latest and most
  complete account of the species of Chaetognatha, arranges them under three genera, which he
  characterises as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(i.) <i>Sagitta</i> Slabber.&mdash;Two pairs of lateral fins, two rows of spines on the head.
  The lateral thickening of the epidermis absent or insignificant.</p>

  <p>Under this genus are included nine definite species and five others&mdash;<i>S. gracilis</i>
  Verrill, <i>S. elegans</i> Verrill, <i>S. darwini</i> Grassi, <i>S. diptera</i> d'Orbigny, and
  <i>S. triptera</i> d'Orbigny&mdash;whose position, owing to the inadequacy of their description,

  <p>The distribution of the other species may be mentioned. <i>S. hexaptera</i> is the largest
  Chaetognath known, and reaches in the adult stage a length of 7 cm. It is very widely distributed,
  being found in practically all the temperate and warm seas, usually at the surface of the water,
  though at times it is found at a depth of one metre, or even deeper. <i>S. lyra</i>,
  Mediterranean, very rare. <i>S. tricuspidata</i>, widely distributed. <i>S. magna</i>,
  Mediterranean and Madeiran, living at the surface. <i>S. bipunctata</i>, the most frequently

  <p><i>Krohnia</i> has but two species: <i>K. hamata</i> M&ouml;bius, with a length of 3-4 cm., found in
  the North Atlantic and at considerable depths, 200 to 300 fathoms; and <i>K. subtilis</i> Grassi,
  1.5 cm. long, with an extraordinary slender body and a relatively large head, found at Messina,
  but very rare; as a rule only one specimen has been found at a time.</p>

  <p>(iii.) <i>Spadella</i> Langerhans.&mdash;A single pair of lateral fins; these are situated on
  the tail segment. Behind the head a thickening of the epidermis extends down each side of the body
  to the fin, or even farther. Two rows of spines on the head. Small animals, not longer than 1
  cm.</p>

  <p><i>S. cephaloptera</i> Busch is the smallest species of Chaetognatha, attaining at most a
  length of .5 cm. The body is not so transparent as in other species, and is of a yellowish colour.
  It has been found from the Orkney Islands to the Mediterranean. Strodtmann is of the opinion that
  the three species <i>S. mariana</i> Lewes, <i>S. batziana</i> Giard, and <i>S. gallica</i>
  Pagenstecher differ from the above-named only in size, or that their description is too indefinite
  to permit of accurate <span class="pagenum" id="page193"><span

  <i>S. pontica</i> Uljanin, from the Black Sea; <i>S. marioni</i> Gourret, from the Gulf of Lyons;
  and <i>S. draco</i> Krohn, Mediterranean and Madeiran, and from the Canaries.</p>

  <p>The Rotifera are microscopic animals, the largest not exceeding one-eighth of an inch in
  length. According to Hudson and Gosse,<a id="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> they are
  first recorded in an observation of the Rev. John Harris, in 1696, of "an Animal like a large
  Maggot which could contract itself into a Spherical Figure, and then stretch itself out again; the
  end of its Tail appeared with a <i>Forceps</i> like that of an <i>Ear-wig</i>."<a id="NtA_234"
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> This was certainly a Bdelloid Rotifer.</p>

  <p>In 1703 Leeuwenhoek<a id="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> gave a fuller
  description of a tubicolous form, probably <i>Limnias</i>, and noted the peculiar appearance of
  the ciliary wreath as "two wheels thickset with teeth as the wheel of a watch." He also noted a
  little later<a id="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> the way in which <i>Melicerta</i>
  (see p. <a href="#page206">206</a>) builds its tube, and was the first to observe the
  revivification of certain species after drying.<a id="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>
  Joblot, a French professor of mathematics, in 1718 figured and described a large number of new
  genera and species with more or less fantastic details. Baker's figures<a id="NtA_238"
  href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> are a considerable advance on Joblot's, and his descriptions
  of habits are still fresh and accurate. Eichhorn found a number of new and interesting forms; and
  O. F. M&uuml;ller, influenced by the new discipline of Linnaeus, not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page198"><span class="smaller">{198}</span></span>only figured many species, but gave good
  short diagnoses of their characters. Ehrenberg in 1838 brought out his magnificent
  <i>Infusionsthierchen</i>, which contains descriptions and figures of what are now divided into
  Protophyta, Protozoa, Rotifera, and Gastrotricha. Dujardin's monograph on the "Infusoires," in the
  <i>Suites &agrave; Buffon</i>,<a id="NtA_239" href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> was in several respects
  an advance on Ehrenberg, whose power of observation was so great as to render his mistakes the
  more inexplicable. But Ehrenberg ever adhered to his errors as firmly as to his facts.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of Rotifers among microscopic plants induced the botanists Cohn and Williamson<a
  id="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> to work at their structure; the group has been
  studied by men engrossed in other professional cares, such as Gosse, Bedwell, Moxon, Rousselet,
  and Maupas. Huxley,<a id="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> Leydig,<a id="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> and Cohn<a id="NtA_243" href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>
  studied Rotifers in the '50's and early '60's with a precision the more remarkable when we
  remember the imperfect methods then available. This period was closed by the valuable monograph
  published in Arlidge's (4th) edition of Pritchard's <i>Infusoria</i>,<a id="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> under the supervision of W. C. Williamson. Leidy began the
  study of the American Rotifers. Eckstein<a id="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> gave a
  careful and interesting account of the species about Giessen in a richly illustrated paper. In
  recent times the modern methods of histological and embryological research have been applied by
  Vallentin,<a id="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> Plate,<a id="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> Tessin,<a id="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> and
  Zelinka,<a id="NtA_249" href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> the three <i>Studien ueber
  Rotatorien</i> of the last author being indispensable to every student, and containing a full
  bibliography.</p>

  <p>Hudson and Gosse's Monograph (1886-89) contains a history of the class to which, as to the
  whole book, we are deeply indebted; and a full systematic account of all published species.<a
  id="NtA_250" href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> C. Rousselet has introduced a method<a
  id="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> of preparation of Rotifers in microscopic slides
  which enables workers to preserve the types they figure and describe for future identification and
  comparison. Gunson Thorpe has collected and studied Rotifera in China and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>Australia. It would be unfair not to record
  here the invaluable services of the late Thomas Bolton, and his son of the same name, both of
  Birmingham, and of J. Hood of Dundee, who have found and widely distributed living specimens of
  new, rare, and interesting species.</p>

  <p><b>Definition of the Class.</b>&mdash;We may define Rotifera as a class of minute bilaterally
  symmetrical animals, with a chitinous integument, a soft terminal "disc" fringed by a complex
  ciliary "wreath," an anterior or subventral mouth, and a dorsal cloacal aperture, beyond which the
  body is usually prolonged into the "foot" or process bearing cement glands, and serving for
  attachment, temporary or permanent. The body-cavity has no epithelial lining, and is traversed by
  nerves and muscles. The alimentary canal possesses a chitinous gizzard or <i>mastax</i> of
  peculiar arrangement, and it usually opens into a cloaca. The nervous centre consists of a
  ganglion on the dorsal side of the pharynx, to which a second one on the ventral side is sometimes
  connected to form a complete ring; eyes and bristle-bearing feelers are usually present as
  sense-organs. A paired system of renal tubes serves for excretion, opening through a median
  contractile bladder into the ventral side of the cloaca. The sexes are distinct; but the males
  (Fig. 107), which mostly lack digestive organs, occur <span class="pagenum" id="page200"><span
  class="smaller">{200}</span></span>rarely, and the females are usually viviparous, or carry about
  the eggs till they are hatched; while, owing to the rarity of the males, parthenogenesis is
  habitual. Fission and budding are alike unknown. The fertilised eggs are of the kind termed
  "winter" or "resting" eggs, and resist conditions adverse to life.</p>

  <p>The Rotifera are of cosmopolitan distribution; most of the species inhabit fresh water, whilst
  some are brackish, and a few are marine; 84 genera and about 700 species have been described.</p>

  <p><b>External Features.</b><a id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a>&mdash;The body is
  divided into three regions: (1) the <i>head</i>, ending in the <i>disc</i>, which bears the
  ciliary <i>wreath</i>; (2) the <i>trunk</i>, containing the viscera; (3) the <i>foot</i>, which
  only contains muscles, nerves, and cement-glands. The general form of the <span
  class="smaller">BODY</span> varies greatly: it is spherical in <i>Trochosphaera</i>, ovoid in
  Asplanchnidae, conical in Scirtopoda, Triarthridae, and <i>Synchaeta</i>; moderately elongated in
  the majority of the Ploima, among which some forms are very flat, like <i>Pterodina</i>,
  <i>Metopidia</i>, and <i>Brachionus</i>; shortly elongated and cylindrical in <i>Hydatina</i>
  (Fig. 106), Notommatidae, and many others.  In <i>Taphrocampa</i> it is cylindrical and segmented,
  while the segments are <span class="pagenum" id="page201"><span
  class="smaller">{201}</span></span>telescopic in the Bdelloida, both ends being retractile into
  the middle segment. In most attached, tube-dwelling forms the body is ovate, tapering behind into
  the elongated stalk-like foot.</p>

  <p>The <span class="smaller">FOOT</span> at the hinder end of the body is usually more or less
  jointed; in <i>Pterodina</i> and <i>Brachionus</i> it is long, transversely wrinkled, and
  retractile. Usually it terminates in a couple of acute, mobile toes, perforated at the tips by the
  ducts of the pedal glands (Fig. 106, <i>fg</i>), whose viscid secretion serves to anchor the
  animal. In <i>Rotifer</i> there are three of these toes, which are retractile, and in addition
  there are in this genus, as in most of the Bdelloida, toe-like pointed spurs in pairs on the more
  proximal joints of the foot. In <i>Callidina</i> the spurs are often perforated, and the toes are
  replaced by numerous openings on the last joint of the foot (Fig. 109, A); while in
  <i>Discopus</i> the end of the foot expands into a large disc, with numerous pores for the
  exudation of the pedal cement, and there are no spurs. In <i>Pedalion mirum</i> the foot is
  represented by two tubular processes ciliated at the apex and at the outer side near the base
  (Fig. 117, <i>f</i>). These are inconstant in size and form, that of one side being sometimes
  reduced or absent, while both are absent in the closely allied species <i>P. fennicum</i>.</p>

  <p>In Melicertidae and Flosculariidae the long foot ends in an expanded disc, which is cupped and
  ciliated in the larva (Fig. 112, B) and in the larva-like male (Fig. 107); but in two species it
  is prolonged into a long flexible thread which is not contractile. The foot is also elongated in
  the Bdelloid genus <i>Actinurus</i> and the Ploimal genus <i>Scaridium</i>. It forms a mere
  ventral disc in <i>Apsilus</i> (and <i>Atrochus?</i>), and is absent in Asplanchnidae (except
  <i>Asplanchnopus</i>), Triarthridae, and Anuraeidae, and in the genera <i>Trochosphaera</i>
  (Melicertaceae) and <i>Pompholyx</i> (Pterodinidae).</p>

  <p>The fringed spines of Triarthridae are jointed appendages moved by powerful muscles; in
  <i>Triarthra</i> one is median and ventral, the others being attached to the shoulders. In
  <i>Polyarthra</i>, there are twelve flattened and serrated spines, a bunch of three being attached
  to the dorsal and ventral faces of either shoulder. An easy transition leads to the hollow
  appendages of Scirtopoda, which end in a fringe of bristly hairs, themselves feathered with finer
  hairs (Fig. 117). These processes are in <i>Pedalion</i> six in number, two median (respectively
  dorsal and ventral), two antero-lateral, and two postero-lateral. As they contain proper muscles,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page202"><span class="smaller">{202}</span></span>and the
  postero-lateral pair contain part of the nephridia and bear the lateral antennae, they are true
  outgrowths of the body, and are not homologous with the spines of Triarthridae.</p>

  <p>The front of the body constitutes the <span class="smaller">HEAD</span>, which is scarcely
  distinct, though usually separated by a slight neck-like constriction. The <span
  class="smaller">DISC</span>, which terminates the head, varies greatly in shape and in the
  arrangement of its parts. Imagine a circular funnel, finely ciliated within, and with the mouth at
  the bottom, the prominent rim bearing two zones of cilia, the inner or anterior being the coarser,
  and termed the "trochus" or <i>hoop</i>; the outer finer, and termed the "cingulum" or
  <i>girdle</i>, while a very finely ciliated groove lies between the two zones. Either or both of
  these zones may be interrupted on the dorsal or ventral median line, or both; and the
  funnel-shaped mouth may be shifted&mdash;usually ventrally, so that it forms only a dilatation of
  the ciliated groove. Again, the wreath as a whole may be festooned or lobed; or the lobing may be
  confined to the area between the cingulum and trochus, as in most Ploima (Figs. 106 and 108, 3).
  Very frequently on these lobes adjacent cilia are fused together during life, producing "vibratile
  styles," whose true nature is only revealed after death. In Microcodonidae the structure of the
  disc (Fig. 108, 1) nearly conforms to the primitive type; but the ciliated groove is absent, and
  the "trochus" is in two separate half-elliptical bands. In the Flosculariaceae (Fig. 108, 6) the
  mouth is also central, the disc is funnel-shaped, <span class="pagenum" id="page203"><span
  class="smaller">{203}</span></span>and the trochus is a horseshoe-shaped ridge, with its ends
  dorsal and raised into prominent knobs. The margin of the funnel is in Flosculariidae (Fig. 115)
  usually lobed, and furnished either with exceptionally strong cilia, or else with very long
  bristles which are usually passive. However, by the retraction of the lobes that bear them they
  are clasped together like casting-nets to enclose prey brought into the funnel by the action of
  the trochal cilia. An external ring of cilia in <i>Floscularia mutabilis</i> and <i>F.
  pelagica</i> serves for swimming. In Apsilidae the margin of the disc bears neither cilia nor
  bristles, but is either simple and ring-like, or is produced into tentacles (Fig. 112, C). The
  oral funnel is probably represented in Flosculariaceae by the continuation of the small central
  mouth into a ciliated tube (Fig. 115, C, <i>tf</i>), open below, and hanging freely down into the
  crop.</p>

  <p>In all other cases the mouth is displaced, and lies in the groove and on its ventral side
  (except in <i>Conochilus</i>, where it is dorsal, Fig. 108, 5). In the Bdelloida the disc is
  prolonged into two great lobes like kettle-drums, round the posterior, external, and ventral edges
  of which run the trochus, cingulum, and ciliated groove (Fig. 108, 2). All three are interrupted
  behind in the median line; ventrally the groove widens into the oral funnel, the cingulum is
  continued into a sort of spout-like lower lip (Fig. 109, C, D, <i>l</i>), and the trochus is
  absent. The body is prolonged dorsally above the lobes into a two-jointed <i>proboscis</i>, ending
  in a ciliated cup overhung by two dorsal flaps: this we regard as a detached portion of the
  wreath.</p>

  <p>This "Bdelloid" type of wreath occurs also in Scirtopoda (Fig. 117), and in the Ploimal genera
  <i>Triarthra</i>, <i>Pterodina</i>, and <i>Pompholyx</i>. A simpler wreath of essentially the same
  type occurs in Asplanchnaceae and Melicertaceae; the disc is not prolonged into drum-shaped lobes,
  but is thin at the rim, where it bears the triple ciliated zone, interrupted on the dorsal median
  line and depressed ventrally into the oral funnel. In the Melicertidae, moreover, the disc is
  widened into a great plate-like extension, often beautifully lobed; and in many of the species a
  ciliated cup lies ventral to the lips, and is connected with the groove by a short ciliated
  channel on either side (Figs. 108, 4, and 116). Even the simpler wreath of Asplanchnidae is
  complicated by stronger lobes on either side bearing vibratile styles.</p>

  <p>The most complex discs are found in Ploima, especially in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page204"><span class="smaller">{204}</span></span><i>Brachionus</i>, <i>Hydatina</i>, and
  <i>Synchaeta</i>, since the groove is replaced by a zone of lappets, as above mentioned. In
  <i>Proales</i> the whole face of the disc is strongly ciliated. The wreath is reduced in the
  parasitic genera <i>Drilophagus</i>, <i>Albertia</i>, <i>Balatro</i>, and the Seisonaceae; in
  <i>Adineta</i> and <i>Taphrocampa</i> it is only represented by a general but scanty ciliation of
  the disc.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The head is very frequently retractile, as a whole, by strong muscles. In Bdelloida the disc
  proper is retracted when the animal crawls, while the proboscis is exserted (Fig. 109). Ciliated
  patches occurring outside the region of the disc point to <span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span
  class="smaller">{205}</span></span>a primitive condition when the whole surface of the body was
  ciliated, as does the partial ciliation of the foot in certain groups. <i>Synchaeta</i> and many
  Notommatidae possess a pair of lateral, hollow, ciliated pits on the body, which can be everted to
  serve as additional swimming organs; these are termed "auricles."</p>

  <p>The <i>cuticle</i> varies much in texture. It may be smooth and flexible, dotted or shagreened,
  or in the Loricata firm and of definite shape, constituting a <i>lorica</i>, which may be more or
  less distinctly divided up into areas or separated into distinct pieces. In this case it resists
  decomposition, and several species are only known by this "skeleton." In <i>Ploesoma</i> it is
  much thickened and looks like a honeycomb. A regular alternation of harder and softer zones
  effects the annulation of the body in certain genera.</p>

  <p>The <i>hypoderm</i> or protoplasmic layer of the skin has no cellular boundaries, though it
  contains large and distinct nuclei; it is usually somewhat granular. It forms the wall of the
  body-cavity, which contains a transparent liquid without corpuscles.</p>

  <p>The principal <i>external glands</i> are the pedal or cement-glands, which secrete a viscid
  substance that sets in water and serves to anchor the animal. They are formed from an ingrowth of
  the hypoderm, are usually paired, and open by fine ducts on or near the apex of the toes, when
  these processes of the foot are present (Fig. 106, <i>fg</i>). These glands are mostly absent when
  there is no foot, as in most Asplanchnidae and in Anuraeidae, but in <i>Asplanchna herrickii</i> a
  small gland on the ventral side of the cloacal aperture appears to represent the last rudiment of
  the foot.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, the ciliated ventral cup below the disc of many Melicertidae secretes a
  viscid substance (Fig. 116, <i>p</i>); and possibly the whole surface of the body is secretory in
  those species of this group, and of the Flosculariidae, whose tube (Fig. 115, A) is uniform and
  not made of pellets. In several other species belonging to Bdelloida and Ploima-Illoricata a
  viscid secretion of the surface of the body renders it "sordid" with adherent particles of
  dirt.</p>

  <p>When the secretion takes the form of a tube, the body can be wholly withdrawn into it by the
  contraction of the foot. In <i>Floscularia</i>, <i>Stephanoceros</i>, and <i>Conochilus</i> the
  tube is hyaline and thin-walled; in <i>Oecistes</i> and <i>Cephalosiphon</i> it is more or less
  floccose; and in <i>Limnias</i> it is thin, firm, and annulated. In <i>Melicerta</i> and some
  species of <i>Oecistes</i> the tube thus secreted by <span class="pagenum" id="page206"><span
  class="smaller">{206}</span></span>the body is only formed in a very young state. In <i>M.
  janus</i> and <i>M. pilula</i> it is increased by the successive deposition of ovoid faecal
  pellets on to the rim. In <i>M. ringens</i> (Fig. 116) and <i>M. conifera</i> pellets are formed
  of the excess of the food particles brought to the disc by the ciliary current; they are carried
  through the gutters on either side of the projecting ventral lip or "chin" into the ciliated
  glandular cup on that side of the head. Here, as they revolve, they are cemented together into a
  pellet which is spheroidal in the former species, cylindro-conoidal with a basal hollow like a
  rifle-bullet in the latter. After a pellet is completed the animal stoops down and deposits it on
  the edge of the tube. This may easily be verified by furnishing a young <i>Melicerta</i> with
  water containing solid particles of carmine. <i>M. tubicolaria</i> forms a thick tube which is
  laminated, the laminae being directed upwards and outwards, and having diatom shells, etc.,
  between the layers. In this case we have observed that the faeces are pellucid, and sometimes are
  so ejected as to lie in a sheet against the funnel-shaped mouth of the tube, and we are inclined
  to believe that the tube itself is formed altogether in this way. A similar process probably
  occurs in <i>Oecistes crystallinus</i> and <i>Oe. umbella</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>muscles</i> are simple elongated fibres, usually having near the middle a mass of
  granular protoplasm containing a nucleus; they may be smooth or striated. The principal muscles of
  the body are conspicuously striated in many active free-swimming forms (<i>Pedalion</i>,
  <i>Synchaeta</i>, <i>Pterodina</i>, <i>Triarthra</i>).</p>

  <p>The muscles of the body-wall are transverse and longitudinal. They are best seen in Bdelloida.
  The principal muscles of the body-cavity are longitudinal; the most conspicuous and constant are
  the retractors of the disc and of the foot, protraction of these organs being usually accomplished
  by the contraction of the transverse muscles. Special muscles effect the vigorous springing of the
  Triarthridae and Scirtopoda; in the former group the muscles only raise the spines, and their
  elastic recoil is the actual mechanism of progression; but in the latter (Fig. 117) special flexor
  muscles of the limbs are the effective agents of the leaping movements.</p>

  <p><b>Movements.</b>&mdash;The Rotifera vary very greatly in their movements. The cilia of the
  disc, and especially of the trochus, are the principal organs of prehension of food, and also of
  swimming when <span class="pagenum" id="page207"><span class="smaller">{207}</span></span>the
  animal is not fixed by its foot. In some cases, as in Bdelloida, the cilia lash downwards
  successively in the longitudinal plane of the body (Fig. 109, C, D); this motion during fixation
  produces a hollow vortex ring, like the rings of a skilled cigarette-smoker, but when the animal
  is free it determines a simple forward progression through the water. In other cases the animal
  rotates on its long axis, or may even turn somersaults (<i>Synchaeta</i>). The appearance of the
  spokes of a wheel is a pure illusion due to the greater visibility of the cilia in their slow
  recovery than in their instantaneous down-lash. The finer cilia of the groove and cingulum play a
  very minor part in the act of swimming, and in the production of the great vortices at the edge of
  the disc when the animal is fixed; they serve to direct the particles brought by the vortices to
  the edge of the disc onwards towards the mouth. It is easy to see that the stream must be in
  opposite directions on opposite sides of the groove; its prolongation across the dorsal median
  line would be useless, which explains the existence of the dorsal median gap. At the ventral side
  we usually find a prominent ciliated lip, whose cilia work outwards, and carry off the excess of
  food particles as by an overflow spout. In many cases among the Notommatidae, Coluridae, etc., the
  disc serves as much for creeping over organic d&eacute;bris as for swimming.</p>

  <p>We have already noticed the springing bristles and limbs of the Triarthridae and Scirtopoda
  respectively; the great foot of <i>Scaridium</i> is also used for leaping. The Bdelloida have the
  power of retracting their disc and progressing in loops like a leech or looper (Geometrid)
  caterpillar.</p>

  <p>Baker, in a letter addressed to Martin Folkes, Esq., President of the Royal Society, dated
  London, 16th January 1744-5,<a id="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> gives the
  following lively account of the aspect and movements of <i>Philodina roseola</i> belonging to this
  group, with figures, some of which we reproduce from the original copper-plate engraving:&mdash;"I
  call it a <i>Water Animal</i>, because its Appearance as a living Creature is only in that
  Element. I give it also for Distinction Sake the Name of <i>Wheeler</i>, <i>Wheel Insect</i> or
  <i>Animal</i>; from its being furnished with a Pair of Instruments, which in Figure and Motion
  appear much to resemble Wheels. It can, however, continue many Months out of Water, and dry as
  Dust; in which Condition its Shape is globular, its Bigness exceeds not a Grain of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page208"><span class="smaller">{208}</span></span>Sand, and no Signs of Life
  appear. Notwithstanding, being put into Water, in the Space of Half an Hour a languid Motion
  begins, the Globule turns itself about, lengthens by slow Degrees, becomes in the Form of a
  <i>lively Maggot</i>, and most commonly in a few Minutes afterwards puts out its Wheels, and swims
  vigorously through the Water in Search of Food; or else, fixing by its Tail, works them in such a
  Manner as to bring its Food to it. But sometimes it will remain a long While in the Maggot Form
  and not shew its Wheels at all....</p>

  <p>"If the Water standing in Gutters of Lead, or the slimy Sediment it leaves behind, has any
  Thing of a red Colour, one may be almost certain of finding them therein,<a id="NtA_255"
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> and, if in Summer, when all the Water is dried away, and
  nothing but Dust remains, that Dust appears red, or of a dark brown, one shall seldom fail, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page209"><span class="smaller">{209}</span></span>on putting it into Water, to
  discover Multitudes of minute reddish Globules, which are indeed the Animals, and will soon change
  their Appearance, in the Manner just now mentioned....</p>

  <p>"A Couple of circular Bodies, armed with small Teeth like those of the Balance-Wheel of a
  Watch, appear projecting forwards beyond the Head, and extending sideways somewhat wider than the
  Diameter thereof. They have very much the Similitude of Wheels, and seem to turn round with a
  considerable Degree of Velocity, by which Means a pretty rapid Current of Water is brought from a
  great Distance to the very Mouth of the Creature, who is thereby supplied with many little
  Animalcules and various Particles of Matter that the Waters are furnished with.</p>

  <p>"As these <i>Wheels</i> (for so from their Appearance I shall beg Leave to call them) are every
  where excessively transparent, except about their circular Rim or Edge on which the Cogs or Teeth
  appear, it is very difficult to determine by what Contrivance they are turned about, or what their
  real Figure is, though they seem exactly to resemble Wheels moving round upon an Axis....</p>

  <p>"As the Animal is capable of thrusting these Parts out, or drawing them in, somewhat in the Way
  that Snails do their Horns, the Figure of them is different in their several Degrees of Extension
  and Contraction, or according to their Position to the Eye of the Observer, whereby they not only
  appear in all the various Forms before represented, but seem at certain Times as if the circular
  Rim of the Wheel or Funnel were of some Thickness, and had two Rows of Cogs or Teeth, one above
  and the other below that Rim."</p>

  <p><b>Digestive Organs.</b>&mdash;The <i>pharynx</i> is usually a narrow ciliated tube, which
  varies in length from genus to genus, but in no other important point, save in Flosculariidae,
  where it assumes the form of a crop, into which the mouth hangs freely down as a narrow ciliated
  tube. At its lower end is an enlargement, the <i>mastax</i> or gizzard.<a id="NtA_256"
  href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> This is a strong muscular sac containing the <i>trophi</i> or
  hard chitinous chewing organs, with an <span class="pagenum" id="page210"><span
  class="smaller">{210}</span></span>antero-ventral inlet from the pharynx, and a postero-dorsal
  outlet through which the food passes into the stomach either directly or through a slender gullet
  (Fig. 106, <i>oe</i>). In the ventral wall of the gizzard of most Ploima is a median piece, the
  <i>fulcrum</i>, from which run forwards and upwards two pieces, the <i>rami</i>, which are hinged
  on the fulcrum. The Y-shaped structure formed of these three pieces is called the <i>incus</i>
  (anvil). At either side of the gizzard and at a higher level is a paired piece, the
  <i>malleus</i>, so called from its resemblance to a hammer, of which the <i>manubrium</i> (handle)
  looks backwards, and is embedded in the side walls of the mastax, while the toothed claw or
  <i>uncus</i> looks forwards and inwards, and is hinged at its inner side with the tip of the
  ramus. As the unci and rami are usually strongly toothed, this gizzard forms a very efficient
  apparatus for chewing. In some cases, when the pharynx is short and dilatable, the points of the
  unci and rami may be protruded for biting, for clinging to the host (in the parasitic genera
  <i>Albertia</i> and <i>Drilophagus</i>), or for the prehension of food (Rattulidae, etc.).</p>

  <p>The type we have just described is termed the "malleate" type (Fig. 111, A). If all the trophi
  are slender and scarcely toothed, we have the "virgate" type (C), which is frequently <span
  class="pagenum" id="page211"><span class="smaller">{211}</span></span>asymmetrical. In the
  "submalleate" type (B) the mallei only are slender; in the "forcipate" type (D) both the unci and
  rami are slender and sharply pointed.<a id="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> In the
  "malleoramate" type (E) the manubrium is a curious looped structure, while the uncus is formed of
  a number of parallel slender elongated teeth; this characterises the family Melicertidae, and the
  genera <i>Triarthra</i>, <i>Pterodina</i>, and <i>Pedalion</i>. In the "uncinate" type (G) the
  mallei are simply incurved hooks with a few teeth at the free end, the rami are simple or absent,
  and there is no fulcrum; this type occurs in Flosculariaceae only. In Asplanchnidae the rami are
  large and hooked, constituting the "incudate" mastax (F); but here reduced mallei are often
  present, and in <i>Asplanchnopus</i> they are almost as well developed as in Melicertidae,
  affording a transition to the malleoramate type. In this group too the mastax has a very peculiar
  form; it is divided into two chambers, dorsal and ventral. The dorsal chamber forms a great
  purse-like sac or crop, with a framework of four longitudinal bars: into this the gullet and
  pharynx open. The ventral pouch is much smaller, and in its base the large rami are inserted, so
  that they can be protruded into the crop. This ventral sac with the rami may even be everted
  through the crop and the mouth, to swallow the small Rotifers and Entomostraca which form the food
  of this group, or to eject the undigested remains of the food. Two lateral sacs open at the
  junction of the ventral pouch and the crop, but whether they play a part in the deglutition of
  food or in the disgorging of faeces is uncertain. The fact that the whole of this apparatus is
  lined by a non-ciliated chitinous cuticle justifies our view that it is simply an enlargement and
  specialisation of the mastax.</p>

  <p>The trophi in Bdelloids also are only represented by the rami, which have the form of segments
  of a sphere, excavated on the curved sides for the attachment of muscles, and transversely ridged
  on the two flat sides; the gizzard is here called "ramate" (H).</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the characters of the gizzard are very useful for classification, only
  breaking down indeed in the <span class="pagenum" id="page212"><span
  class="smaller">{212}</span></span>Ploima; for though the majority of these present one or other
  of the four varieties of the malleate type, <i>Triarthra</i> and <i>Pterodina</i> (but not the
  other genera of their respective families) have the gizzard malleoramate.</p>

  <p>The <i>oesophagus</i> is, when present, a contractile ciliated tube in which the food makes no
  sojourn on its way to the stomach.</p>

  <p>The <i>stomach</i> may be nearly spherical, ovoid, or elongated and cylindrical. Its walls are
  formed of large cells, often granular and sometimes brownish, whence a hepatic function has been
  assigned to them. Its apertures are both surrounded by constricting muscular fibres. The
  <i>intestine</i> may be simple or divided by a similar constriction into <i>intestine</i> proper
  and <i>rectum</i>. The whole of the alimentary tract, with the exception of the mastax, is richly
  ciliated within. The rectum opens into the slender non-ciliated cloaca. The intestine is sharply
  bent upwards and towards the back in the tubicolous forms, but is nearly straight elsewhere; in
  <i>Trochosphaera</i> and <i>Apsilus</i> it is bent ventrally. In Asplanchnaceae and in
  <i>Paraseison</i> there is no rectum, the stomach being a blind sac.</p>

  <p>The so-called <i>salivary glands</i>, usually two in number, open into the pharynx or mastax;
  and the paired <i>gastric glands</i> (Fig. 106, <i>gg</i>) open into the oesophagus or stomach.
  While the prehension of food is usually accomplished by the ciliary current of the disc and
  pharynx, we have seen that a more active swallowing action takes place in Flosculariaceae and
  Asplanchnidae, which devour whole Algae, Infusoria, and even other Rotifers, the long spines of
  <i>Triarthra</i> not availing as a protection. Many Ploima put out the tips of their trophi to
  nibble at d&eacute;bris, or, in the case of <i>Diglena</i> and <i>Distemma</i>, to attack Desmids, or the
  Infusorian <i>Stentor</i>. But this use of the trophi is most efficient in <i>Ploesoma</i>.
  Bilfinger<a id="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> writes: "It has the courage to attack
  larger Rotifers; thus I was able to observe under the microscope how it fell upon a
  <i>Rattulus</i> but little smaller than itself and destroyed it. First it plunged the sharp prongs
  of its mastax deep into the tender frontal area of its unhappy victim; then followed a pumping
  action of the gizzard, and stroke by stroke the whole contents of the victim's body passed into
  the brigand's stomach." From this it is an easy transition to the ectoparasitism of
  <i>Drilophagus</i>, <i>Balatro</i>, and <span class="pagenum" id="page213"><span
  class="smaller">{213}</span></span>some species of <i>Albertia</i>, which cling to their host by
  the exserted trophi.</p>

  <p><b>Renal Organs.</b>&mdash;The kidneys consist of a pair of convoluted tubes, formed of a
  succession of perforated, so-called "drainpipe" cells (Fig. 106, <i>k</i>); they open directly or
  indirectly into the cloaca. Their walls are thin in the straight parts, but thick and glandular in
  the coils which occur at intervals. These tubes bear little tag-like appendages, hanging freely
  into the body-cavity, often widening towards the free end, and flattened or circular in section
  (Fig. 106, <i>ns</i>). They show during life a peculiar flickering motion in their interior, like
  the equivalent "flame-cells" of many Platyhelminthes (see p. <a href="#page25">25</a>), and are in
  function the representatives of the multicellular renal funnels of Annelids. On one side,
  especially on the edge of the flattened tags, the appearance is as of a tapering whip-like lash,
  attached by its base to the free end of the tag and waving in its cavity; but the side view of the
  flattened tags shows an appearance of successive transverse or oblique waves. In many if not all
  cases the free end of the tag is closed by a vacuolated plug of protoplasm, which sometimes at
  least bears two flagella waving freely in the body-cavity. The probable explanation of the two
  distinct wave appearances within the tag is that the protoplasmic plug bears on its inner face a
  row or tuft of long cilia hanging down into the cavity of the tag. The tags probably keep up a
  current of liquid through the kidneys, while the contents of the body-cavity are constantly
  replenished by osmosis.</p>

  <p>The two renal tubes may end blindly below the disc, or else join by a short transverse dorsal
  communication in front of the brain, as in <i>Stephanoceros</i>, <i>Atrochus</i> (Fig. 112, C),
  and <i>Apsilus</i> among Flosculariaceae, <i>Lacinularia</i> among Melicertidae, and
  <i>Hydatina</i> among the Illoricate Ploima (Fig. 106, <i>rc</i>). In some species of
  <i>Asplanchna</i>, if not all, a recurrent branch occurs opening at either end into the main tube
  of its own side.</p>

  <p>The kidneys unite to discharge into the cloaca near its orifice, and on its distal (primitively
  ventral) side in many Melicertidae. In Bdelloida the common duct formed by their fusion opens into
  the ventral side of a dilated bladder-like section of the cloaca (Fig. 109, A, <i>bl</i>), which
  contracts rhythmically to discharge the liquid; while in the majority of the class they open
  singly or by a common duct into a separate contractile vesicle or <i>bladder</i>, which also
  discharges at regular intervals into the cloaca on its ventral or distal side (Figs. 106,
  <i>bl</i> and 112).</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 112.</span>&mdash;Apsilidae: <b>A</b>, <i>Apsilus
      lentiformis</i>, &#x2640;, dorsal view (after Metschnikoff); the square brain is seen with
      nerves to the lateral antennae; <b>B</b>, larva of <i>A. lentiformis</i> (?), showing the

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This bladder may reach when expanded one-third the diameter of the whole animal, and contract
  as often as three times per minute; so that in a period of nine minutes a bulk of water equal to
  that of the animal must have diffused through the body-wall, to be removed by the kidneys. It is
  obvious that while the function of the kidneys is primitively excretory, the passage of the water
  through the body must bring in the oxygen dissolved in the external <span class="pagenum"
  id="page215"><span class="smaller">{215}</span></span>medium, and carry off the carbonic acid
  formed in the tissues, and so fulfil the act of respiration. This mechanism is physiologically
  comparable with that of the contractile vacuole of fresh-water Protozoa. In a few genera
  (<i>Conochilus</i>, <i>Lacinularia</i>, <i>Pterodina</i>) the kidneys open separately after a
  slight dilatation into the cloaca.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The nervous centre of the Rotifera is the <i>brain</i> (Fig. 112,
  C, <i>br</i>), a ganglion lying dorsal to the pharynx; and when this is short it may be
  immediately below the surface of the disc (<i>Microcodon</i>). In Bdelloida a second ganglion is
  present below the pharynx, and is connected with the former by lateral cords which contain
  ganglion cells. From the brain, nerves are given off to the disc, to the muscles, and to the
  integument of the body, as well as to the sense organs. The largest nerves are two given off from
  the sides of the brain, each of which divides into a lateral and a ventral trunk, which run nearly
  the whole length of the animal.</p>

  <p>The brain of several Notommatidae has a curious appendage, white by reflected light and very
  opaque; it is a sac full of chalky mineral matter, which dissolves readily in dilute acids.</p>

  <p><b>Sense Organs.</b>&mdash;The most widely diffused sense organs are the antennae or feelers,
  which may serve for touch or smell, or possibly both. Each antenna is a conical or tubular
  outgrowth of the skin; from its apex projects a fine pencil of sense hairs borne on a protoplasmic
  cushion, which receives a nerve. Often the antenna is elongated, and may then contain a muscle by
  which it is retractile (lateral antennae of <i>Melicerta</i>); sometimes it is reduced to a slight
  prominence bearing the setae (dorsal antenna of this genus). There are usually three
  antennae&mdash;a <i>median dorsal</i> (Figs. 109, B, <i>a</i>, and 112, C, <i>am</i>) and two
  <i>lateral</i> (Figs. 106, 112, C, and 115, A, <i>al</i>), often approximated towards the ventral
  surface, and sometimes all but fused on the middle line, or completely united (<i>Conochilus
  dossuarius</i>, <i>Copeus caudatus</i>).<a id="NtA_259" href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Most Rotifers possess an organ of sight. This in its simplest form is a refractive globule
  seated in a red pigmented cup through which the nerve passes; in other cases it lies directly on
  the brain. Very frequently the eye is paired (Figs. 112, B, and 115, A); and these paired eyes may
  lie on the brain, and then <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span
  class="smaller">{216}</span></span>are so close together that the pigment-cups have the shape of
  an <i>x</i>, or else they are seated in the dorsal region of the head behind the disc. In some
  cases they lie just under the ciliary wreath, or even within the region of the disc, and pass
  towards its ventral side in <i>Pedalion</i> (Fig. 117, A, <i>e</i>). In <i>Rotifer</i> they lie
  just under the dorsal side of the proboscis just below its apex. The median and two lateral eyes
  often exist together, as in <i>Eosphora</i>; and sometimes additional paired eyes exist. In
  <i>Furcularia longiseta</i>, var. <i>grandis</i> a pair of pigment spots (eyes?) occurs at the
  hinder end of the body just in front of the foot.</p>

  <p>The active Ploima show a spontaneity of movement and marked power of avoiding obstacles, etc.
  This is still more marked in the very active <i>Pedalion</i>, which, as Rousselet notes, clearly
  avoids capture by the dropping tube, aided by its sense of sight, as he suggests, or by the
  tactile or olfactory powers of the antennae. They must rank as psychically high in the scale of
  creatures of simple organisation.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs and Reproduction.</b>&mdash;The most conspicuous organ in the female is
  the large <i>yolk-gland</i> or <i>vitellarium</i> (Figs. 106 and 109, A, <i>vm</i>), which was
  regarded as the ovary by all the older observers. It consists usually of eight cells, with
  conspicuous nuclei, lying on the ventral side of the stomach, and frequently displaced to one
  side; but in most Asplanchnidae it forms a broad transverse band of numerous cells. In
  <i>Pterodina</i> it is horseshoe-shaped, while in Seisonaceae and Bdelloida it is paired, either
  gland containing four or eight cells. The true <i>ovary</i> or <i>germarium</i> (Fig. 106,
  <i>gm</i>) lies more or less hidden between the yolk-gland and the stomach; it is composed of
  numerous minute rounded cells, of which the hindmost for the time being enlarges by nutrition from
  the yolk-gland, and finally receives a membranous shell. This true ovary is somewhat lateral in
  most Rotifers, but is median in Asplanchnidae, and paired in <i>Pterodina</i>, Bdelloida, and
  Seisonaceae. A membranous covering is common to the ovary and yolk-gland (paired when these are
  paired); it is continued into a thin-walled tube or oviduct, which opens into the cloaca on its
  ventral side beyond the bladder or common renal duct. In the viviparous species the mature ovum
  (Fig. 112, <i>em</i>) usually lies in the oviduct, dilating it into a sort of "uterus" until the
  birth of the young. The ordinary eggs or "summer eggs" are formed without any <span
  class="pagenum" id="page217"><span class="smaller">{217}</span></span>fertilisation, and develop
  immediately; they are often hatched within the tube of the tubicolous species.</p>

  <p>Under certain conditions the unfertilised females produce exclusively smaller eggs, which
  develop into males. Maupas<a id="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> has demonstrated
  that a rise in temperature to a minimum of 26&deg; C. (79&deg; F.) is the efficient factor. But as
  Bergendal points out,<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> the critical temperature
  probably varies with the antecedent conditions of the race, since males occur in Greenland at a
  very much lower temperature; and it would seem probable that a temperature approaching that at
  which the pools habitually dry up is what is necessary for the production of males, as a provision
  for those fertilised eggs, which, having a hard shell often adorned with prickly prominences, and
  usually remaining for some time before development, are capable of withstanding drought; such eggs
  are termed "winter eggs," but a better term would be "resting eggs" (German, "Dauereier").<a

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The male organs consist of a testis (Fig. 113, A, <i>te</i>) with accessory glands, a large
  seminal vesicle, and a protrusible or projecting penis (<i>p</i>). In <i>Notommata</i> and
  <i>Diglena</i> true intromission at the cloaca (B) has been seen by many observers; but it <span
  class="pagenum" id="page218"><span class="smaller">{218}</span></span>appears equally certain that
  in many cases the male bores into the body-wall of the female at any point, and deposits the
  spermatozoa in the body-cavity, so that they must pass through the wall of the oviduct to effect
  fertilisation. Maupas finds that the process of fertilisation is ineffective except upon such
  newly-hatched females as would otherwise be the parents of small male eggs; that fertilisation is
  inoperative even for these at a later age when their eggs have begun to mature; and that it is
  wholly useless for those that lay ordinary summer eggs. The parent of male or winter eggs would
  thus be comparable to the queen bee, which if not fertilised produces drones. These sexual
  relations find a close parallel in the Ostracod and Phyllopod Crustacea, as well as in many
  plant-lice (Homoptera).</p>

  <p><b>Development.</b>&mdash;This has only been fully studied in the summer egg; in
  <i>Brachionus</i> by Salensky,<a id="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> in
  <i>Melicerta</i> by Joliet<a id="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>; in <i>Eosphora
  digitata</i> and several other species by Tessin<a id="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>; in <i>Callidina</i> and <i>Melicerta</i> by Zelinka,<a
  id="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> the last two observers having utilised modern
  methods of research.<a id="NtA_267" href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> We shall base our account
  on Zelinka's observations. As in the case of most "parthenogenetic" eggs, the ovarian egg begins
  by a very uneven division to form two cells: the minute "first polar body" which undergoes no
  further development; and the definitive egg, which by its repeated divisions gives rise to the
  tissues and organs.</p>

  <p>Segmentation is very unequal, and recalls that of Molluscs in several respects. The first
  division gives rise to a smaller and a larger cell. Both of these divide again, the latter
  unequally, so that now there are three smaller cells and one large one; and after repeated
  divisions of the small cells and unequal divisions of the larger one, a stage is reached where
  there are a number of small cells and one large one, which sinks in and is overgrown by the small
  ones. Just prior to this the large cell undergoes equal divisions; its cells are the "hypoblast"
  cells (Fig. 114, <i>hyp</i>), and give rise to the gullet, stomach, and intestine, with their
  appendages, and the generative organs; while the smaller cells constitute the "epiblast"
  (<i>ep</i>), which gives rise to the body-wall and muscles, to the cement glands, nervous system,
  pharynx and mastax, and probably to the kidneys.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Owing to the elongation of the body within the narrow space of the egg the hinder part is bent
  up on the ventral surface (D, E); and this part, narrower than the rest, forms the foot, the
  centre of which is at first occupied by a column of hypoblast. The cloaca is now formed by a
  dorsal ingrowth of epiblast (the "proctodaeum") at the junction of the foot and the body
  (<i>an</i>). The hypoblast in the body anterior to the cloacal ingrowth forms the digestive
  apparatus; the part immediately behind forms the reproductive organs (<i>o</i>); and the hindmost
  part apparently disappears. An ingrowth of epiblast at the extreme tip of the foot gives rise to
  the cement glands (<i>fg</i>). The muscles arise from the epiblast cells. The disc arises from the
  modification of epiblast cells lateral to and behind the mouth, enclosing a so-called "polar
  area"; it is completed by the transformation of cells on the ventral side of the mouth. The brain
  (<i>br</i>) is formed by the multiplication of epiblast cells; and in Bdelloida a ventral ingrowth
  below the mouth forms the sub-oesophageal ganglion. The ciliated cup in <i>Melicerta</i> is formed
  as a ventral hollow, only later on united with the ciliated furrow of the wreath by the lateral
  grooves.<a id="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> In <i>Melicerta</i> the two eyes are

  wreath; and in the tubicolous forms the cupped end of the foot-gland is ciliated, and two eyes are
  present on the polar area, which later sink in, and often disappear more or less completely. It is
  stated that the young hatched from winter eggs do not pass through this larval state.</p>

  with long setae (<i>Floscularia</i>) or coarse cilia (<i>Stephanoceros</i>), or entire
  (Apsilidae); an outer row of fine cilia rarely present; trochus a horseshoe, open behind. Oral
  funnel a slender tube hanging freely into a large pharyngeal crop; trophi uncinate projecting
  freely into the crop. Kidneys often united by an anterior cross-piece. Body-wall often containing
  a definite system of canals, filled with refractive granules, and serving by their contraction to

  <p>The family Flosculariidae contains some most exquisite forms; <i>Stephanoceros</i>, the "Crown

  <p>The Melicertidae embrace a large number of tubicolous forms, many of which are social. This
  habit is especially noticeable in <i>Lacinularia socialis</i>, which forms a gelatinous
  incrustation easily seen by the naked eye; and in <i>Conochilus volvox</i>, which forms
  free-swimming globular aggregates, the young attaching themselves when hatched to the centre of
  the ball, and the ball splitting up into two as soon as undue pressure is exerted at the periphery
  by overcrowding. In this genus the eyes are very conspicuous in the adult, as they are in the
  similar free-swimming aggregates of <i>Lacinularia racemovata</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Trochosphaera</i> (Fig. 118, D) is remarkable for its peculiar <span class="pagenum"
  id="page222"><span class="smaller">{222}</span></span>spherical shape, the absence of a foot, the
  limitation of the viscera to the lower hemisphere, and the dorsal position of the ovary. But a
  reference to the figure will show that the outgrowth of a foot in the quadrant between the mouth
  and anus and the flattening of the upper hemisphere would bring its organs on the whole into close
  correspondence with those of the rest of the Order. It is recorded from South China, the
  Philippines, and North-East Australia, and has only been seen by Semper, the founder of the genus,
  and by Thorpe, who saw the male of the first species, and described a second.<a id="NtA_270"

  (except in <i>Adineta</i>) chiefly composed of two dorsal lobes like kettle-drums, wholly
  retractile; a dorsal proboscis or trunk-like prolongation of the body ends in a ciliated, sensory,
  and adhesive cup used in crawling, and overhung by a pair of membranous flaps. Trophi ramate;
  brain with a ventral ganglion, forming a complete ring. Eyes, two on the proboscis or brain, or
  absent. Bladder a mere dilatation of the rectum. Foot often possessing blind spurs, as well as two
  or three retractile perforated toes, or forming a terminal disc perforated by numerous pores of
  the cement glands, rarely ciliated.<a id="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This group is remarkable for the great resisting powers of its members to drought and to heat
  and cold when dried, a fact which may explain the absence of males, though Janson records the
  occurrence of winter eggs in four species of <i>Callidina</i> and in <i>Adineta vaga</i>. The body

  <p>To this group belongs the eyeless <i>Hydatina</i>, a classical object of study, common in
  greenish pools, whose male was the first male Rotifer to be figured by Ehrenberg (1838), though he
  did not recognise its nature, and gave it the name of <i>Enteroploea hydatina</i>. <i>Rhinops</i>
  has the back of the corona curiously prolonged forwards into a sort of proboscis bearing two eyes.
  Some species of <i>Notommata</i> and <i>Proales</i> are distinctly annulated; in
  <i>Taphrocampa</i> the segmentation is so marked as to give the appearance of mesenteric septa
  extending inwards from the body-wall to the intestine. <i>Microcodon</i> has a wreath which is
  very peculiar in its extreme simplicity, with the mouth nearly central, and the eye lying just
  dorsal to the mouth. The Triarthridae, which resemble the Scirtopoda in having strong leaping
  spines fringed by fine bristles, should perhaps be placed in the next sub-Order.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order B. Loricata.</b>&mdash;Ploima with a firm elastic cuticle <span class="pagenum"

  continuous, or divided by thinner strips into plates or shields, which again may be areolated. The

  <p>The group includes a number of very minute forms, besides others conspicuous both for size and
  beauty. A soft dorsal flap above the head occurs in <i>Stephanops</i>; also in Coluridae, a large
  family of minute species, where the flap is movable, and looks in profile like a hook overhanging
  the forehead. The genus <i>Pterodina</i>, like <i>Pedalion</i> and <i>Triarthra</i>, combines a
  Bdelloid disc with malleoramate trophi, while its exsertile wrinkled foot ends in a ciliated cup
  like that of a larval tubicolous species.</p>

  <p><i>Brachionus</i>, a large, often flat, transparent form, with a long wrinkled foot, is a very
  common genus, known to the earlier observers, and repeatedly figured by them. <i>Pompholyx</i> has
  a sack-like lorica, no foot, and carries its immense egg suspended by an elastic thread from the
  cloaca. The Anuraeidae lack the foot, and often have great spines or bristles projecting from the
  lorica, which no doubt facilitate floating. They are abundant in the "plankton" or floating fauna
  of large lakes far from the shore. Many marine species belong to this family.</p>

  <p><b>Order VII. Seisonaceae.</b>&mdash;Marine Rotifers parasitic on the Crustacean
  <i>Nebalia</i>; males resembling the females. Body elongated, with a slender retractile neck, a
  much reduced disc, an elongated foot with a terminal perforated disc as in <i>Callidina</i>.
  Trophi virgate exsertile. Genito-urinary cloaca opening at the base of the neck in the male, at

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The habitat of Rotifers is well known to the student of pond life. Every
  dip from a greenish pool will give us a supply, if there be not an excessive contamination by
  manure; and such pools give us some of the largest and most beautiful forms, such as
  <i>Hydatina</i> and <i>Brachionus</i>, swimming about among the fibrous Algae and feeding on the
  organic d&eacute;bris among them. Almost any organic infusions freely exposed to the open air will yield
  Ploima shortly after the active putrefaction is completed. The finer water-weeds yield most of the
  beautiful tubicolous forms. A whole group of species and genera are quasi-pelagic in fresh and
  salt water, constituting a large proportion of the "plankton" or floating life near the surface;
  and some of these are found in deep water or in the depths of the lakes. Among them are the
  Asplanchnidae, Triarthridae, and Anuraeidae. A number of Loricates, such as <i>Notholca</i> and
  <i>Eretmia</i>, are armed with long spines, which doubtless render floating easier.</p>

  <p>Among tubicolous forms <i>Conochilus volvox</i> and <i>Lacinularia racemovata</i> have this
  pelagic habit, forming floating globular or ovoid colonies, and two species of <i>Floscularia</i>
  also float freely in their tubes.</p>

  <p>The following forms occur in salt or brackish water,<a id="NtA_276"

  and contributes to the phosphorescence of the ocean.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page227"><span class="smaller">{227}</span></span></div>

  <p>Other forms again are parasitic. <i>Proales werneckii</i> is found in <i>Vaucheria</i>, a
  coarse, dark green, thread-like Alga found in fresh water; and the closely allied <i>P.
  parasita</i> is not uncommon in the beautiful floating green spheres of <i>Volvox</i>.<a
  id="NtA_277" href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> <i>Albertia</i>, <i>Drilophagus</i>, and
  <i>Balatro</i> are parasitic on or in fresh-water Oligochaetes; the curious Seisonaceae are
  parasitic on <i>Nebalia</i>, a small Crustacean easily obtained in masses of whelk's eggs; the
  aberrant Bdelloid <i>Discopus</i> attaches itself to the surface of the Holothurian
  <i>Synapta</i>. Similarly among this last Order <i>Callidina parasitica</i> attaches itself to the
  limbs of the fresh-water Crustacea <i>Gammarus</i> and <i>Asellus</i>. These are rather commensals
  than true parasites. The species of <i>Brachionus</i> often attach themselves temporarily to the
  common water-flea <i>Daphnia</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides a few Ploima, the vast majority of the Bdelloids live in or among mosses and their
  roots. Many <i>Callidina</i> inhabit cup-like hollows in the leaves of the scale mosses
  (Jungermanniaceae), especially of the genus <i>Frullania</i>. Almost all the members of this Order
  are susceptible of desiccation and revival; certain species, such as <i>Rotifer vulgaris</i>,
  <i>Philodina roseola</i>, <i>Adineta vaga</i>, etc., can be readily obtained by moistening gutter
  dust. The mechanism of the process is as follows: when desiccation is gradual the animals close up
  their telescopic bodies and excrete gelatinous plugs at either end, which effectually seal them
  against further drying; if, however, they be dried on a slide without any d&eacute;bris, the process is
  too rapid for them to protect themselves, and they therefore die. This was dimly seen by others,
  and clearly demonstrated by H. Davis,<a id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> who
  records the following experiment:&mdash;The Rev. E. J. Holloway, having found <i>Philodina
  roseola</i> in gutters, placed strips of paper there in the rainy season, and succeeded in
  obtaining clean gatherings, taking dry groups of a hundred together, having a varnish-like
  covering all over; and being glued to one another, mostly in one plane, and to the paper, forming
  a pavement. In the dry condition they resist extremes of temperature; thus Zelinka found <span
  class="pagenum" id="page228"><span class="smaller">{228}</span></span><i>Callidina</i> revive
  after an exposure of -20&deg; C. (-4&deg; F. or 36&deg; of frost), and immersion in hot water at 70&deg; C. (158&deg;
  F.). They will also resist deprivation of air in a vacuum of an ordinary air-pump, but not the all
  but perfect exhaustion of the Sprengel pump.</p>

  <p>A very curious fact in relation to this Class is that often when a new form is once described
  from a single locality, fresh and widely distant stations for it rapidly become known.<a
  id="NtA_279" href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> Thus <i>Pedalion mirum</i>, first found at
  Clifton in 1872 by Hudson, was a few years after captured in a small pool above tide-marks on a
  rocky islet in Torres Straits. Since then it has been recorded from many different European
  stations, and a second closely allied species has been found in Finland. So a species of
  Ehrenberg's<a id="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> was not seen again till within the
  last decade or so; but since then it has been independently found and described by six observers,
  who have given it as many distinct generic names. In the case of <i>Pedalion</i> it may well be
  that, as Hudson suggests, the species is of southern origin and has followed the flag, the winter
  egg being conveyed in dust by ships or travellers.</p>

  <p>The above account of the habits gives the key to the collection of the various forms. The
  weed-loving species are collected with the weeds, and will keep with these in vessels if screened
  from direct sunlight and protected against dust. The free-swimming forms may be collected by
  sweeping with a net of fine gauze, with a bottle fixed in the bottom.</p>

  <p>Except for their power of resisting desiccation, Rotifera are not very long-lived, and the
  males are especially short-lived; the most exact observations are those of Maupas on
  <i>Hydatina</i>. He found that the greatest age of the unfertilised female was thirteen days,
  during which it could produce some fifty eggs; the fertilised female lives for seven or eight
  days, producing about sixteen eggs; while the male dies in two or three days.</p>

  <p>The preservation of Rotifers has been recently reduced to a fine art by Rousselet, who uses a
  solution consisting of cocaine hydrochlorate, 1 gramme; water, 50 cc.; and methylated spirit, 12
  cc. This will keep without deterioration. When in use it <span class="pagenum" id="page229"><span
  class="smaller">{229}</span></span>must be diluted in the proportion of two volumes to three of
  water. This solution is added cautiously to the capsule in which the Rotifers lie, and they are
  watched till their ciliary motions slacken; when this happens a drop or two of osmic acid solution
  (&frac12; to 1 per cent) is added; the Rotifers are then sucked up by a capillary pipette, and
  transferred to fresh water; and then into a solution of "Formaline" diluted to contain 2&frac12; per cent
  of formic aldehyde. In this solution they are transferred to shallow cells, ground out of the
  centre of an ordinary glass slide, covered with thin glass, and sealed.<a id="NtA_281"
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> Other methods of preparing Rotifers for minute study will be
  found in the papers of Plate, Tessin, and Zelinka.</p>

  <p><b>The zoological affinities</b> of the Rotifers have long been a subject of keen interest. As
  early as 1851 Huxley<a id="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> suggested that they
  represent a primitive form, preserved, with modifications, in the larva of Molluscs, Annelids and
  other worms, and Echinoderms. Similar views were later maintained by Lankester,<a id="NtA_283"
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> who termed the larva of Polychaets, etc., a "trochosphere,"
  for which "trochophore" has been substituted in order to avoid confusion with the Rotifer
  <i>Trochosphaera</i>; Balfour,<a id="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> Hatschek,<a
  id="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> Kleinenberg,<a id="NtA_286"
  href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> and others have developed these views. Serious difficulties,
  however, arise in the detailed comparison of Rotifers with this type; and the special students of
  this Class have found it practically impossible to agree in the identification of the various
  parts, a difficulty especially felt in the case of the Rotiferan genus <i>Trochosphaera</i>,
  though this is just the one which presents the closest superficial resemblance to the Trochophore
  larva. I have been induced to take a view of the structure of Rotifers that brings it into close
  relationship with the lower Platyhelminthes, and with the more primitive larva of the Nemertines
  termed <i>Pilidium</i> (Fig. 60, p. <a href="#page113">113</a>). This is hemispherical, ciliated
  all over, with the mouth in a ventral funnel lined by fine cilia; while the edge is fringed with
  two rows of strong cilia, separated by a finely ciliated groove, like those of the ciliary wreath
  of a Rotifer.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sides are produced on either side into lappets, which we do not take into account. A
  cup-shaped depression at the apical pole is lined by sense-cells, bearing long cilia which are
  probably sensory. A ring of nerve-cells passes within the ciliated rim of the hemisphere, and the
  stomach is a blind sac. If we compare this organism with a Rotifer, we find that the wreath
  corresponds in both, the funnel of the disc in such forms as Flosculariidae and <i>Microcodon</i>
  leading to the mouth of <i>Pilidium</i>, while the gut is blind in Asplanchnidae and in some of
  the highly developed Seisonidae. The circular nerve-ring of <i>Pilidium</i> is in many Rotifers
  only represented by its anterior part, the brain; though in Bdelloids a sub-oesophageal ganglion
  completes the ring. This leaves a difficulty with regard to the apical sense organ; but it is easy
  to understand that an organ of sensation should become an organ of fixation. In this case the foot
  with its glands would correspond to the sense organ of the Trochophore larva; and it retains its
  primitive ciliated character in the larvae and males of many Rotifera, and the adult female of
  <i>Pterodina</i> and <i>Callidina tetraodon</i>. Embryology tells <span class="pagenum"
  id="page231"><span class="smaller">{231}</span></span>us that the anus of Rotifers cannot be
  homologous with that of Annelids, etc., for it is formed outside the area of the blastopore: it is
  an independent formation, probably due to the coalescence of the originally blind intestine at its
  extremity with the earlier genito-urinary cloaca. On this view we must change the orientation of
  the Rotifer, and place it, like a Cuttlefish, mouth downwards: for "anterior and posterior" we
  must substitute <i>oral</i> (or <i>basal</i>) and <i>apical</i>; for "dorsal" and "ventral" we
  must use <i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior</i>; while "right" and "left" are unchanged. And this
  correctly expresses the actual space-relations in those Ploima like <i>Rattulus</i> that swim with
  their disc in contact with the organic d&eacute;bris on which they feed, with the foot turned outwards
  and backwards. As these views are now published for the first time, I have thought it wiser to
  keep to the accepted relations in the general description, a course which has the advantage of
  avoiding difficulties in the study of the literature of the Class.</p>

  <p>The supposed resemblance of <i>Pedalion</i> to the Crustacea is probably the result of
  convergence, not of consanguinity. The Polyzoa are a group of freely-budding organisms whose
  structure otherwise recalls in many respects that of the attached Rotifers; but a close
  investigation reveals so many differences in structure, orientation, and development, that we
  cannot regard the two groups as at all closely allied.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Thus the Rotifers may be regarded as a group apart, but probably representing an
  early offshoot from a free-swimming Platyhelminth, probably a Rhabdocoele; the modifications being
  the loss of the general ciliation of the surface, the arching of the back into an elongated vault,
  the conversion of the inner half of the pharynx into a gizzard, the change of position of the
  genital and urinary apertures to the antero-dorsal surface, and the opening of the intestine into
  the genito-urinary cloaca.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Gastrotricha.</b></p>

  <p>This small and very homogeneous group consists of minute fresh-water organisms, closely
  resembling many Ciliate Infusoria in their movements, habit and habitat. They were first described
  in detail by Ehrenberg, and placed by him and Dujardin in the neighbourhood of Rotifers. In recent
  years A. C. Stokes<a id="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum"

  of a number of new species and their habits, the latter a complete monograph of everything that is
  known of the Order.</p>

  <p>The Gastrotricha dwell among filamentous Algae and organic d&eacute;bris, and are of frequent

  <p>We shall follow Zelinka in his description of the common species <i>Chaetonotus larus</i> as a
  type. The body is nearly circular in section, flattened a little on the ventral side. The
  apertures are the terminal mouth; the anus, nearly terminal and slightly dorsal; the two kidney
  openings, ventral, nearly half-way down the trunk; besides the pore of a cement-gland on either
  terminal process. The short ventral and post-anal portion of the trunk with its processes
  therefore corresponds to the foot of a Rotifer. The integument of the body is a thin nucleated
  hypoderm, not <span class="pagenum" id="page233"><span
  class="smaller">{233}</span></span>distinctly divided into cells, covered by a chitinised cuticle;
  it bears cilia, sensory hairs, and peculiar scale-like processes, sometimes produced into long
  bristles.</p>

  <p>The cilia are chiefly arranged in two ventral bands, each extending nearly the whole length of
  the body, and composed of a series of transverse rows of single cilia; along these bands the
  hypoderm is thickened and more richly nucleated. The sides of the head also bear numerous long
  cilia.</p>

  <p>The scales are hollow processes of the cuticle overlapping from before backwards. A ventral row
  lies between the ciliary bands; two series of alternating dorsal rows lie on the back and sides of
  the animal, and in the hirsute species it is these that are produced backward into bristles. A
  single large scale, the "frontal shield," protects the head above and behind, but does not extend
  down to the ventral surface. On either side of the head is a pair of flattened oval areas, the
  "lateral fields." From between these on either side springs a tuft of motile sensory hairs. Two
  pairs of similar tufts arise dorsally on the front margin of the frontal shield, and a fourth pair
  spring from the ventral surface a little behind the mouth. These hairs are distinguished from
  ordinary cilia by their length, and their insertion on large nucleated cells receiving nerves; two
  pairs of similar hairs lie farther back on the dorsal surface, one in the front of the neck, one
  near the base of the pedal processes.</p>

  <p>The <b>muscles</b> lie some in the body-wall, and some traverse the body-cavity; only six pairs
  occur, simple, unstriated, and longitudinal. There are neither transverse nor circular
  muscles.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> is very simple and nearly straight from mouth to anus; it may be
  divided into pharynx, gullet, stomach, and rectum. The mouth is circular, and looks forwards and a
  little downwards. From the mouth opens the pharynx, a short chitinous tube, capable of eversion by
  being pushed forwards by the gullet; it bears half-way down a circlet of curved hooks, which open
  out when it is everted; within these are tooth-like thickenings.</p>

  <p>The oesophagus or gullet is thick and muscular, extending through the whole of the neck of the
  animal; its cavity, as well as the opening from the pharynx, is triradiate like a leech-bite, but
  can be dilated by the action of the muscular walls, inserted into a firm external cuticle; the
  internal wall is also cuticulised, <span class="pagenum" id="page234"><span
  class="smaller">{234}</span></span>not ciliated as in Rotifers. The hinder end of the gullet is
  produced into a short, wide, membranous funnel projecting freely into the midgut or stomach. The
  latter is elongated and oval, composed of four rows of hexagonal cells, with large nuclei. This is
  separated by a distinct constriction or sphincter from the short pear-shaped rectum, which opens
  by a minute anus on the back just in front of the pedal processes.</p>

  <p>The food is chiefly organic d&eacute;bris; but Gastrotricha have been seen to attack large Infusoria
  by nibbling, and to swallow the protoplasm as it exudes from the wound in their prey.</p>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b> is chiefly composed of the large brain, a ganglion lying like a
  saddle above and on the sides of the gullet, and in direct continuity with the nerve-cells of the
  cephalic sense-hairs. A pair of dorsal nerve-trunks extend along the whole length of the gullet.
  The sense-hairs described with the general integument may be organs of external taste ("smell") or
  of touch. Eyes have been described in several species; and though Zelinka has failed to verify
  this, I have myself seen a pair of minute red eyes in the back of the head of an animal (probably
  a <i>Chaetonotus</i>), whose hasty escape into a mass of d&eacute;bris prevented my determining its
  species.</p>

  <p>The <b>kidneys</b> are paired tubes lying at the sides of the front of the stomach, and sending
  a simple loop into the neck. Each tube is much convoluted, and ends at the one extremity in a long
  "flame-cell," like that of a Rotifer much drawn out, and at the other by a minute pore on the
  outer side of the ventral row of scales.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;Only the female is with certainty known to occur; and the
  eggs, though recalling in their thick ornamented shell the fertilised winter eggs of Rotifers, are
  probably unfertilised and parthenogenetic like the summer eggs. The ovaries are two minute patches
  of cells lying at the junction of the stomach and rectum. The eggs, as they mature and enlarge,
  press against the side and back of the stomach, where they attain a length of one-third to
  one-half that of the mother. The extrusion of the egg has not been observed; but it is laid in the
  angles of weeds, the moulted shells of Entomostraca, etc., where its development may be studied.
  The sculpture of the shell serves to anchor it if laid among weeds. When hatched the head, trunk,
  and pedal processes are of the full adult size, all subsequent growth being limited to the
  neck.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page235"><span class="smaller">{235}</span></span></div>

  <p>The function of testis has been ascribed by Ludwig to a minute granular organ between the
  ovaries above the rectum; if this view be correct the Gastrotricha are hermaphrodite.</p>

  <p>The movements of the Gastrotricha are very elegant, recalling those of the long-necked Ciliate
  Infusoria, like <i>Amphileptus, Lacrymaria</i>, etc., with the characteristic exception that they
  always swim forwards; the grace of their movements being due to the bending of the head and neck
  on the body. Those which are provided with long motile bristles like <i>Dasydetes</i>, alternate
  their gliding with leaps, like the springing Rotifers.</p>

  <p>The Gastrotricha are divided into two sub-Orders&mdash;<span class="sc">Euichthydina</span>,
  with two pedal appendages, containing the genera <i>Ichthydium</i> Ehr., <i>Lepidoderma</i> Zel.,
  <i>Chaetonotus</i> Ehr., and <i>Chaetura</i> Metsch.; and the <span class="sc">Apodina</span>,
  with no pedal appendages, comprising <i>Dasydetes</i> G. and <i>Gossea</i> Zel.</p>

  <p>Their geographical distribution, like that of most microscopic fresh-water organisms, is
  cosmopolitan. Few observers have enumerated the members of this group; of their extra-temperate
  occurrence we have only the single observations of Ehrenberg, Schmarda, and Voeltzkow for Nubia,
  Ceylon, and Madagascar respectively.</p>

  <p>Of the thirty-two species described, twelve are recorded by A. C. Stokes from Maine and New
  Jersey only, besides five others that occur also in Europe. In Europe nineteen species are
  recorded, one of which, <i>Ichthydium podura</i>, has also been found in Nubia and Ceylon. One
  species, <i>Chaetonotus tabulatus</i> Schmarda, has been recorded by its author from Colombia (in
  South America). As of the nineteen European species only seven have been recorded as British, we
  may expect to find that careful study will well repay the student in these islands.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>affinities</b> of this group are probably with the Turbellarians and the
  Nematodes; they differ from the former in the highly developed alimentary canal, and from the
  latter in the possession of the ciliated ventral bands and wreath. The general chitinisation of
  the skin, the primitive body-cavity, the character of the alimentary canal, the ventral opening of
  the renal canals far in front of the anus are characters shared by the Nematodes, many of which
  possess bristles like this group. But their affinity must be rather to some hypothetical ancestral
  group than to any living Nematodes, which are destitute <span class="pagenum" id="page236"><span
  class="smaller">{236}</span></span>of cilia. To the Rotifers the affinity, dwelt on by Zelinka, is
  less close.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The animals of this group are found in shallow seas with muddy bottom, below low-water mark,
  and feed on organic d&eacute;bris. They have been taken in the Black Sea, Mediterranean, British Channel,
  and North Sea, and off the Canary Islands (Lanzarote, Porto Pi, Palma di Mallorca). Their size
  varies from 0.86 mm. &times; 0.22 mm. in <i>Echinoderes spinosus</i>, to 0.14 mm. &times; 0.03 mm. in <i>E.
  kowalevskii</i>.<a id="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>body</b> is protected by a strong chitinous cuticle distinctly annulated, forming eleven
  rings, besides a retractile proboscis obscurely divided into two segments at the apex of which the
  mouth opens. The anus opens on the extreme end of the last segment, which is frequently retracted;
  the genital pores open right and left of the anus; and the renal pores lie on either side of the
  back of the ninth segment. The first ring may be undivided, or else distinctly divided into four
  plates, one dorsal, <span class="pagenum" id="page237"><span
  class="smaller">{237}</span></span>two latero-ventral, and one ventral. In the remaining segments
  each ring has only three plates, one dorsal and two ventral, the two latter being sometimes more
  or less fused in the last or ventral segment. These plates all overlap from before backwards.</p>

  <p>As the name <i>Echinoderes</i> implies (Thorn-skin), the cuticle is produced into points,
  bristles, or spines. The last segment frequently bears a large pair of these, which have been
  compared, on the flimsiest grounds, with the furcal processes of Crustacea and the perforated toes
  of Rotifers and Gastrotricha.</p>

  <p>The proboscis when extruded has the form of a truncated cone, obscurely divided into two
  segments, a ring of strong spines marking the boundary between them, and a second double ring of
  spines surrounding the apex. The eversion is of the type termed by Lankester pleurembolic or
  acrecbolic, the sides being first withdrawn, the apex first extruded.</p>

  <p>As in so many Invertebrata, the epidermis is not separated by boundaries into distinct cells.
  This layer sends out processes each of which lies in a hollow in the thick cuticle, and perforates
  it to end in a fine bristle. Minute orange pigment-granules occur at irregular intervals in this
  hypoderm.</p>

  <p>The <b>muscles</b> of <i>Echinoderes</i> are simple striated bands. Numerous bands lie within
  and attached to the body-wall, extending its whole length; paired dorsi-ventral muscles separate
  the intestine from the reproductive organ on either side, and a complex system effect the
  movements of the proboscis.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The pore at the tip of the proboscis leads into a short
  thin-walled tube, which is rarely evaginated; into the base of this tube projects the short
  bluntly conical apex of the large ovoid muscular pharynx (or gullet?); this is lined by an
  epithelial layer of nucleated protoplasm, which secretes a strong cuticle. The stomach is a wide
  tube, somewhat dilated in each segment between the paired dorsi-ventral muscles, and tapering
  behind to end in the terminal anus. Four minute glands open at the junction of the pharynx and
  stomach.</p>

  <p><b>Kidneys.</b>&mdash;These are a pair of blind pear-shaped sacs, ciliated within (the only
  case of ciliation in <i>Echinoderes</i>), lying in the eighth segment, and opening by the taper
  ends right and left on the back of the ninth segment.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;All that has been clearly defined of this is a small brain or
  ganglion lying dorsally at the junction of the <span class="pagenum" id="page238"><span
  class="smaller">{238}</span></span>pharynx and stomach. From two to eight eye-spots have been
  described by earlier writers, but Reinhard was unable to find them in the (distinct) species which
  he principally worked at, though he noted their existence in the solitary specimen of the original
  species, <i>E. dujardini</i>, which he obtained.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;The sexes are distinct. The reproductive glands form a pair
  of tubular sacs, opening ventrally on either side of the anus, and extending forwards beside the
  gut as far forwards as the fifth to the second segment in the male, but only to the fourth at
  furthest in the female. The ova are large nucleated cells embedded in the protoplasmic lining of
  the ovarian sac, and acquiring a distinct shell as they approach its opening. Three-quarters of
  the testis sac is occupied with granular protoplasm containing a quantity of small nuclei; the
  lower part alone contains mature spermatozoa. Adjoining each external opening in the male are a
  pair of short hollowed spines, which may perhaps serve as organs of copulation; but nothing is
  really known of this process or of the development of the egg. It is almost certain, from the
  absence of developing eggs within <i>Echinoderes</i>, that the genus is not viviparous.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing description it is obvious that <i>Echinoderes</i> approaches the Nematoda
  very closely: the two main points of difference are its ciliated kidneys and its bilaterally
  paired sexual organs. Possibly the study of such forms as <i>Desmoscolex</i> (Fig. 81, p. <a
  href="#page159">159</a>) may reveal closer affinities.</p>

    <p class="sp0">[Zelinka (<i>Verh. D. Zool. Ges.</i>, 1894 and 1898), has given a preliminary

    body-wall, as indeed do the brain and nerve-collar. He divides the genus into two Orders

  WORMS&mdash;THE ARCHIANNELIDA&mdash;ANATOMY OF <i>NEREIS</i>, AS TYPICAL OF THE
  POLYCHAETA</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">Those animals which possess lateral bundles of bristles (technically termed
  "chaetae") for use in locomotion constitute the group of "Bristle-worms," or <b>Chaetopoda</b>.
  The body of these animals is made up of a preoral lobe or prostomium, and a number of more or less
  distinct segments following one another in a line, and repeating one another in their internal and
  external structure. The Chaetopoda embrace the following smaller groups or Orders:&mdash;I.
  Archiannelida, II. Polychaeta, III. Myzostomaria, IV. Oligochaeta. The Archiannelida, although
  without the characteristic chaetae, are yet anatomically so similar to the true Chaetopoda that
  they must be included in the group, just as certain fishes are classed as "Vertebrata," although
  they do not possess vertebrae. The old term Annelida is sometimes used to include the
  above-mentioned groups, together with the Gephyrea<a id="NtA_292"
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> and the Hirudinea or leeches.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Archiannelida.</b></p>

  <p>The Archiannelida are very simple worms, but simplicity may be, and very frequently is, the
  result of degeneration; and it is not always possible to determine whether a simple animal is
  primitively, <i>i.e.</i> ancestrally simple, or whether it is secondarily simplified. Hence the
  term <i>Haplodrili</i> has been employed by Professor Lankester as the name of the group; a term
  which does not prejudge the question as to whether or not the worms are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page242"><span class="smaller">{242}</span></span>"primitive." It is quite possible, and even
  probable, that <i>Dinophilus</i> is ancestrally simple; whilst many features in <i>Polygordius</i>
  appear to be the result of simplification. For this reason it would be well to separate
  <i>Dinophilus</i> from the other two genera, on account of its much less elaborate and more
  generalised structure,&mdash;so generalised, in fact, that the worm is by some authorities placed
  amongst the Planarians; for the present, however, the group Archiannelida may be regarded as
  containing three genera: <i>Dinophilus</i>, <i>Protodrilus</i>, and <i>Polygordius</i>.<a

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 121.</span>&mdash;<i>Dinophilus taeniatus.</i> (From
      Harmer.) The left figure represents the dorsal surface of a young individual, &times; 76; the mouth
      and alimentary tract are seen by transparency: <i>p</i>, prostomium, with two bands of cilia
      and a pair of eyes; <i>a</i>, anus; <i>t</i>, tail; 1 to 5, the segments with ciliated bands.
      The right figure shows the anatomy of the male, &times; 38: <i>b</i>, rectum; <i>c</i>, body-cavity;
      <i>d</i>, vas deferens; <i>m</i>, muscular organ (pharynx); <i>n'</i>, the first nephridium;

      <i>s.x</i>, seminal vesicle (5th nephridium).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Dinophilus</i> is represented on our coasts by at least two species: <i>D. gigas</i>
  Weldon<a id="NtA_294" href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> and <i>D. taeniatus</i> Harmer.<a
  id="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> The latter is about one-twelfth of an inch in
  length, bright orange in colour, and more or less abundant, at springtime, in the rock pools
  around Plymouth, where it may be found amongst green algae, or on the mud at the bottom of the
  pools.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page243"><span class="smaller">{243}</span></span></div>

  <p>The animal consists of a broad prostomium, with a pair of eyes; and of a body, distinctly
  constricted in immature specimens into five or six segments, followed by a short conical tail.
  There are neither chaetae nor tentacles; locomotion is chiefly effected by means of the bands of
  cilia which encircle the body in a regular fashion, two bands round the head, and two round each
  segment in <i>D. taeniatus</i>; in some species there is only a single band on each segment. The
  whole of the ventral surface is covered with cilia, by the aid of which the animal probably
  "creeps" along the weeds.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is straight, and divisible into the regions shown in Fig. 121; a muscular
  protrusible organ, which is a ventral outgrowth of the foregut, is employed as a "sucker." The
  coelom is more or less obliterated (or ill developed). The excretory system in the genus is
  varied: in some species, as in <i>D. gigas</i>, it is stated to be constructed on the Planarian
  plan; in others, as in <i>D. taeniatus</i>, the organs are definite nephridia. Of these tubes
  there are five pairs, the last pair in the male serving as a seminal vesicle. Each nephridium is a
  ciliated tube, the internal end of which lies in the body-cavity and appears to be blocked by a
  ciliated tongue-shaped appendage. The first pair corresponds to the "larval nephridia" of
  Trochosphere larvae.</p>

  <p>The nervous system, which is in contact with the epidermis, consists of a brain in the
  prostomium, and, on each side of the body, a ventral cord with five ganglia, connected by
  transverse commissures in as many segments.</p>

  <p>The sexes are separate, and are usually similar; the male of <i>D. gyrociliatus</i> is,
  however, much smaller than the female. The generative organs occupy the greater part of the
  body-cavity; in the male the testes communicate, by means of the pair of seminal vesicles, with a
  median eversible apparatus. In the female the paired ovaries communicate with a median sac which
  serves as a spermatheca.</p>

  <p>The development is simple:<a id="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> the worm itself
  is more like a larval Polychaete than a full-grown worm. <i>Dinophilus</i> is an extremely
  interesting form, and it has been suggested that, while still possessing certain Planarian
  characteristics, it may be looked upon as closely resembling the ancestor from which the
  Chaetopoda have arisen.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Protodrilus</i> and <i>Polygordius</i> are distinctly Annelidan in character.
  <i>Protodrilus</i><a id="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> is found in the mud of the
  "Pantano," an inlet of the sea near Messina; whilst of <i>Polygordius</i><a id="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> one species at least occurs on our shores, and several others
  in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The worms are cylindrical, with many segments, but these
  segments are only indistinctly marked externally&mdash;by girdles of cilia in <i>Protodrilus</i>,
  or by faint grooves in <i>Polygordius</i>; but there are none of the characteristic Chaetopod
  bristles or chaetae. The small prostomium which overhangs the mouth is provided with a pair of
  ciliated pits, and carries a pair of tentacles, serving as sensory organs, which, in
  <i>Protodrilus</i>, are also respiratory. The anus is surrounded by glandular papillae in
  <i>Polygordius</i>, by means of which the animal can fix itself; these are represented in
  <i>Protodrilus</i> by a couple of processes.</p>

  <p>The nervous system lies entirely in the epidermis. The body-cavity is regularly segmented by
  transverse septa passing from the body-wall to the intestinal wall. The foregut presents a slight
  eversible portion in <i>Polygordius</i>, whilst in <i>Protodrilus</i> it has a peculiar <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped muscular diverticulum on its ventral surface, corresponding with
  the similar apparatus in <i>Dinophilus</i>; it is capable of eversion, and aids the worm in
  burrowing, as well as in seizing and swallowing the mud. The vascular system is represented by a
  dorsal and a ventral vessel, neither of which, however, is contractile. In <i>Protodrilus</i> the
  dorsal vessel divides into two branches in the first segment, each of which passes to the tip of
  the tentacle, and returning, joins its fellow to form the ventral vessel. In some species of
  <i>Polygordius</i> there is a pair of vessels connecting the dorsal and ventral vessels in every
  segment, but no vessel to the tentacle. The blood is colourless in some species of
  <i>Polygordius</i>, but may be yellow (<i>P. neapolitanus</i>), red (<i>P. lacteus</i>), or green
  (<i>P. erythrophthalmus</i>). Paired nephridia, with distinct funnels, occur regularly throughout
  the body.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The sexes are separate in <i>Polygordius</i>, whilst <i>Protodrilus</i> is
  hermaphrodite, bearing ova in the first seven segments and testes in the remaining segments. The
  genital cells are produced from the body-wall in every segment; their mode of discharge is unknown
  in the male <i>Polygordius</i>, though probably the nephridia <span class="pagenum"
  id="page245"><span class="smaller">{245}</span></span>convey the spermatozoa to the exterior; but
  in the female the body-wall ruptures to allow the ova to escape, and then the animal dies. The
  development of <i>Polygordius</i> has been made the subject of very careful study; the larva has
  long been known, and is a typical "trochosphere" of rather a depressed form. This "trochosphere"
  larva is of considerable importance, as it makes its appearance in sundry groups of animals in
  some form or another. Here, in <i>Polygordius</i>, it has the appearance of a couple of wide but
  low cones united together by their bases, which form the equator of the larva. This equator
  carries a double girdle of cilia, dividing the animal into a preoral and postoral region; for the
  mouth is placed on one side of the animal between the two girdles, while the anus lies at the apex
  of the postoral cone, and is surrounded by another girdle of cilia. The alimentary canal is
  divisible into three regions; it is separated from the body-wall by an extensive space, which
  contains cells destined to give rise to muscles and nephridia. A nervous system (apical plate) is
  present at the apex of the preoral cone. This little larva swims freely on the surface of the sea,
  moving, balancing, and feeding by means of the girdle of cilia. It soon increases in length by the
  active growth of the apex of the postoral cone, which becomes cylindrical and then segmented
  externally and internally. The greater part of the original larva remains of the same shape as
  before, and forms the head (prostomium and peristomium): small tentacles grow out of the preoral
  lobe, and after a gradual reduction in the relative size of the "head" by the growth of the
  segmented "body," the animal becomes worm-like and develops into a <i>Polygordius</i>.<a

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Polychaeta.</b></p>

  <p><b>Anatomy of Nereis.</b>&mdash;In order to obtain a general idea of a Polychaete worm, it is
  well to study a concrete example, and for this purpose the common <i>Nereis</i> serves
  excellently. Several species (see p. <a href="#page315">315</a>) occur more or less commonly on
  our coasts, and the general remarks will apply to one as well as to another.</p>

  <p><i>Nereis pelagica</i> Linnaeus reaches a length of 5 to 6 inches, and is about &frac14; inch across.
  It is convex above, nearly flat below. Its <span class="pagenum" id="page246"><span
  class="smaller">{246}</span></span>colour is brown or bronze. The worm, which is to be found in
  shallow water, is made up of a considerable number of rings or segments, constituting the "trunk"
  or "body," terminated at each end by modified segments known as "head" and "tail" (Fig. 122). The
  segments composing the trunk are all alike, except for small proportional differences, and it will
  be convenient to describe a "typical segment" before referring to the head or tail.</p>

  <p>A <b>typical body segment</b> carries on each side a muscular lobed outgrowth, bearing bundles
  of bristles or "chaetae," and filamentous sensory organs known as "cirri." To this lateral
  locomotor organ Huxley gave the name "parapodium" (Fig. 124). Each parapodium or foot consists of
  a basal portion, supporting a dorsal and a ventral process, the "notopodium" (<i>ntp</i>) and
  "neuropodium" (<i>nrp</i>) respectively, each of which is bilobed. The lobes are very vascular and
  glandular, and probably serve as respiratory organs or "gills."</p>

  <p>The chaetae, or bristles, of each bundle project from the mouth of a great sac, the lips of

  at the bottom of the sac. The chaetae of <i>Nereis</i>, as of many other Polychaetes, are of a
  kind usually termed compound or "jointed," each being composed of a long stalk and a small
  "appendix" articulated in a cup at its <span class="pagenum" id="page247"><span

  <p>In addition to these projecting locomotor chaetae, there is embedded in each of the two
  chaetigerous lobes a much stouter and dark-coloured, needle-shaped bristle known as an "aciculum,"
  whose point only just projects beyond the surface. This aciculum extends into the interior of the
  body much farther than do the locomotor chaetae, and it is to it that the muscles serving to move
  the whole bundle of chaetae are attached. The acicula thus serve as an internal skeleton to the
  parapodium. The shape of the parapodium, the relative lengths of cirri and lobes, the shape and
  arrangement of the chaetae, are all employed as specific characters.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page248"><span class="smaller">{248}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <b>head</b> consists of a preoral portion above the mouth, the "prostomium," and a postoral
  region surrounding the mouth, the "peristomium" (Fig. 125). The prostomium varies in shape in
  different species of <i>Nereis</i>; but it always carries on its dorsal surface two pairs of eyes.
  From its narrower anterior end there arises a pair of short, somewhat conical, sensory processes
  known as the "prostomial tentacles." A second pair of processes springs from the under surface,
  and rather to the side of the prostomium; these are known as the "palps," and in <i>Nereis</i> are
  much more conspicuous than the tentacles; each is composed of two parts, a large basal piece and a
  smaller terminal joint, capable of being withdrawn into the former. The palps are highly muscular,
  and though they are sensory organs, act also as great lateral lips.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The peristomium is in many species of <i>Nereis</i> (as in <i>N. pelagica</i>) considerably
  larger than the trunk segments; it carries at its anterior edge four filiform cirri on each side,
  which are directed forwards and used as feelers. They are arranged in couples; a more anterior
  couple of dorsal and ventral cirri, and a more posterior couple of dorsal and ventral cirri.</p>

  <p>The <b>Tail</b>.&mdash;As the most anterior segment is perforated by the mouth, and is modified
  as described above, so the last or anal segment, which carries the anus, differs from the rest. It
  is more or less elongated, cylindrical, and without parapodia or chaetae. It retains, however, its
  pair of ventral cirri, which are very long.</p>

  <p><b>Internal Anatomy.</b>&mdash;In correspondence with the external <span class="pagenum"
  id="page249"><span class="smaller">{249}</span></span>metamerism there is an internal repetition
  of parts. For, except in the anterior segments, where the powerful protrusible pharynx is
  situated, the body-cavity or "coelom" is divided into a series of chambers, by means of muscular
  septa inserted, on the one hand, into the body-wall at the level of the grooves between the
  external segments, and, on the other, into the wall of the alimentary canal. Each of these
  coelomic chambers contains a pair of nephridia, a portion of the intestine, of the vascular
  system, and of the nervous system, as will be seen in Fig. 124.</p>

  <p>The epidermis, which forms the outer part of the <i>body-wall</i>, consists of a single layer
  of cells, covered externally by a thin, tough cuticle. The latter is usually stated to consist of
  the chemical substance known as chitin, but since the cuticle differs from true chitin by
  dissolving in caustic potash after a time, Eisig<a id="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> has suggested that its substance is merely a stage in the
  formation of chitin. The epidermis contains gland-cells, which are especially abundant on the
  lobes of the parapodia. Below the epidermis lies the circular coat of muscles by whose contraction
  the worm diminishes its diameter: it is interrupted on each side at the junction of the parapodium
  with the body. Deeper still lie the longitudinal muscles, which form four great bundles, two
  dorsal, separated by the insertion of a small mesentery and dorsal blood-vessel, and two ventral
  bundles separated in the middle line by the nerve-cords. These longitudinal muscles, by their
  contraction, bend the worm from side to side, and are continuous from segment to segment. A very
  characteristic muscle, present in all the Polychaeta, is an obliquely transverse sheet of fibres
  passing from the body-wall at the side of the nerve-cord to the parapodium, where it spreads out
  and serves to move the parapodium (Fig. 124). All these muscles consist of smooth fibres, as in
  the earthworm.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> may be divided into the following four regions:&mdash;(1) buccal or
  eversible region, (2) pharynx, carrying the great jaws, (3) oesophagus, (4) intestine.</p>

  <p>The first two regions constitute an "introvert" (Lankester<a id="NtA_301"
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a>). When fully everted the whole of the buccal region is turned
  inside out, and the terminal aperture leads directly into the pharynx, which is not everted but
  merely protruded. <span class="pagenum" id="page250"><span
  class="smaller">{250}</span></span>Throughout the following chapters the word "buccal" region is
  used for that part&mdash;if any&mdash;which is thus everted (Figs. 125, 126).</p>

  <p>Both the buccal and pharyngeal regions are wrapped round by several coats of muscle, to form
  apparently a single muscular organ (Fig. 127, <i>sh</i>), which occupies about eight segments in a
  condition of complete introversion. The septa are absent from the anterior part of the body.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      the Chaetopodan "introvert." (From Lang.) <b>A</b> shows the apparatus at rest; the mouth
      leads into the buccal cavity (<i>B</i>), with paragnaths in its wall; <i>P</i>, the pharynx,
      with jaws at its anterior end; <i>c</i>, brain; <i>p</i>, protractor muscles; <i>r</i>,
      retractors. <b>B</b>, the pharynx has been brought forward or protruded by the eversion, or
      turning inside out, of the buccal region, so that the jaws (<i>j</i>) now lie some way in
      front of the head, which is represented by the brain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The buccal region is lined with chitin, which is specially thickened at certain definite spots,
  forming small "denticles" or "paragnaths" (Fig. 125), which have a different arrangement in the
  various species.</p>

  <p>The cavity of the pharynx is narrow and the walls thick and muscular; each side wall carries a
  large, dark, chitinous "jaw" (Fig. 127, J), which is hollow at the base, into which the muscles
  serving to move it are inserted, whilst the apex is solid, curved, and more or less notched. These
  two great jaws are used not only for tearing prey, but for seizing it; for when the pharynx is
  entirely protruded the two jaws are wide apart, and when retraction takes place they come together
  and grasp the prey.</p>

  <p>Eversion of the apparatus is partly effected by protractor muscles (Fig. 126, A, <i>p</i>) and
  partly by the pressure of the coelomic fluid, compressed by the muscles of the body-wall; the
  eversion is stopped at a certain stage by a sheet of muscular tissue or "diaphragm" (Fig. 127,
  <i>diaph</i>) inserted round the buccal region and attached to the body-wall in the second
  segment. The introversion is effected partly by the contraction of this diaphragm and partly by
  the action of powerful retractor muscles (Fig. 126, <i>r</i>) inserted into the hinder end of the
  pharynx and passing to the body-wall (these are removed in Fig. 127). The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>movement of the jaws themselves and of the
  wall of the apparatus is due to other muscles.</p>

  <p>The <i>oesophagus</i> is quite short; into it opens a pair of sacculated diverticula or glands.
   Then follows the <i>intestine</i>, which extends through the rest of the body as a thin-walled
  tube, slightly dilated at the insertion of the septa.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>vascular system</b> consists of a contractile dorsal vessel and of a non-contractile
  ventral vessel extending along the whole length of the body, from each of which paired and
  segmentally-arranged <span class="pagenum" id="page252"><span
  class="smaller">{252}</span></span>vessels pass to the intestinal wall and to the body-wall, and
  here form extensive capillary networks (Fig. 124, p. <a href="#page247">247</a>). This type of
  vascular system is pretty generally adhered to throughout the Order, but in the Terebelliformia,
  Scoleciformia, and Cryptocephala the dorsal vessel and capillary plexus on the intestine are
  replaced by a continuous blood sinus, situated in the substance of the gut-wall. This "perienteric
  sinus" has the same relation to the segmental vessels as the dorsal vessel has in the
  Nereidiformia, and from it a tubular dorsal vessel arises anteriorly. In <i>Arenicola</i> the
  sinus is preceded in the young stage by a network the branches of which gradually enlarge, meet,
  and fuse to form the sinus.<a id="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> Whether it is in
  all cases secondary is a moot point.</p>

  <p>This system of vessels in the majority of Chaetopoda contains a respiratory fluid coloured
  red<a id="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> by haemoglobin in solution; in it float a
  very few small oval nucleated non-amoeboid corpuscles. But the place of this red pigment is taken
  by a green one, named "chlorocruorin," in the Chlorhaemidae and many Sabelliformia;<a id="NtA_304"
  href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> whilst in <i>Magelona</i><a id="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> the blood is tinted madder-pink by a number of globules of
  "haemerythrin." The blood (or "haemal fluid") is driven forwards in the dorsal vessel, and passes
  backwards in the ventral vessel. Respiration in <i>Nereis</i> is carried on by the whole surface
  of the body, but naturally with greater activity in the surface of the parapodia, the lobes of
  which, with their extensive vascular plexus, may be termed "gills"; but it must be borne in mind
  that these organs have other functions as well.</p>

  <p>The <i>coelomic fluid</i>, which fills the general body-cavity, is colourless, and contains
  amoeboid corpuscles or "leucocytes." It corresponds to the lymph of Vertebrates, being nutritive
  in function, in that it conveys absorbed material from the wall of the intestine to the organs of
  the body, and at the same time removes any waste substances from these organs; these waste
  substances contain nitrogen, and are ultimately removed by the nephridia. In <i>Ophelia</i> many
  of the corpuscles contain a curious dumb-bell-shaped rod of chitin, and it has been shown<a
  id="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> that this substance <span class="pagenum"
  id="page253"><span class="smaller">{253}</span></span>is a highly complex form of excretory
  material,&mdash;more complex than guanin, for instance, which exists in the corpuscles of the
  Capitelliformia.</p>

  <p>In Glyceridae, Capitelliformia, and <i>Polycirrus haematodes</i> (a Terebellid), the vascular
  system is absent, and the coelomic corpuscles become coloured by haemoglobin, and in order that
  the coelomic fluid may be distributed to the organs of the body, the peritoneum is ciliated along
  certain definite tracts. The fluid in these "anangian" worms thus combines originally separate
  functions, and behaves like the "blood" of Vertebrates.</p>

  <p>The <b>excretory system</b> is represented by a pair of nephridia in each segment, with the
  exception of a few anteriorly and a few posteriorly. The nephridium of <i>Nereis</i> differs from
  that of most other Polychaetes hitherto examined carefully, and rather resembles that of the
  Oligochaetous Enchytraeids. It consists of a compact gland-like organ, containing a much coiled
  tube, ciliated for the greater part of its length, but deprived of cilia in its last coils; this
  latter part&mdash;or duct&mdash;leaves the "gland" and pierces the body-wall, opening to the
  exterior at the base of the parapodium. The ciliated canal passes forwards into the next segment,
  where it opens by a funnel into the coelom. The lip of the funnel is extremely curious, for the
  cells constituting it are drawn out into very long, delicate processes covered with cilia.<a
  id="NtA_307" href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In most Polychaetes the nephridium is a wide, sac-like tube as in <i>Arenicola</i><a
  id="NtA_308" href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> (Fig. 129). Its walls are covered by a dense
  network of blood-vessels, and it not only acts as an excretory organ, but also as a genital duct
  (see p. <a href="#page273">273</a>).</p>

  <p>Excretion, in the strict sense of the word, is carried out by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page254"><span class="smaller">{254}</span></span>the cells forming the wall of the tube; they
  remove waste materials from the blood distributed over the surface of the organ. But, in addition,
  there is a removal from the coelom, by means of the funnel, of any dead or dying coelomic
  corpuscles which in their turn have eaten up or otherwise destroyed foreign bodies (such as
  Bacteria, etc.) that may have entered the animal.</p>

  <p>In <i>Nereis</i> there is in each segment, in addition to the pair of nephridia, a pair of
  "dorsal ciliated organs" (Goodrich) (<i>cil.org</i> in Fig. 124). Each appears as a wide-mouthed
  funnel, greatly folded, and without any permanent outlet. But it is possible that these organs
  function as genital ducts, and that the external aperture will make its appearance temporarily at
  the period of maturity. This "dorsal ciliated organ" has not been met with in allied
  genera&mdash;such as <i>Eunice</i>, <i>Nephthys</i>, <i>Polyno&euml;</i>, <i>Glycera</i>&mdash;where
  the nephridium is a wide tube, and serves as a genital duct.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b>, as in all Chaetopods, consists of a dorsal cerebral ganglion or
  "brain" (Fig. 127, <i>br</i>), connected by circum-buccal commissures with the anterior end of a
  ventral chain of ganglia. The brain occupies the prostomium,<a id="NtA_309"
  href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> and from it nerves pass away to the prostomial tentacles and
  palps. The circum-buccal commissures spring from the outer corner of the brain, and from each
  arises a nerve to the first pair of peristomial cirri. The first ventral ganglion lies in the
  third segment, and represents at least two ganglion-pairs fused together, for from it arise (1) a
  pair of nerves to the second pair of peristomial cirri and (2) a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255"><span class="smaller">{255}</span></span>pair to the first parapodium. In the
  remainder of the body there is a ganglion in each segment, whence nerves pass outwards to the
  parapodium and muscles of the segment (Fig. 124).</p>

  <p>In <i>Nereis</i> the apparently single ganglion in each segment really consists of two halves,
  and the apparently single cord which traverses the whole length of the body consists of two
  closely apposed cords. In some worms, such as Serpulidae, the two cords are more or less widely
  separated, and the two ganglia of each segment are thus distinct, and connected by a transverse
  commissure. In <i>Nereis</i>, as well as in many other Polychaeta, the nerve-cords lie within the
  body-wall, but in other cases they lie in the epidermis, as they do in Archiannelida.</p>

  <p>The visceral nervous system, supplying the muscles of the pharynx, is frequently highly
  developed. In <i>Nereis</i> it arises on each side by two roots, one from the brain, the second
  from the circum-buccal commissure.</p>

  <p>The <b>organs of sense</b> in <i>Nereis</i> are eyes, tentacles, palps, and cirri. The four
  eyes, which rest upon the brain, have the structure represented in Fig. 130. The retina consists
  of a single layer of cells containing pigment; each cell is drawn out peripherally into a
  nerve-fibre, whilst centrally it forms a cuticular product&mdash;the "rod" (<i>h</i>). The edges
  of the retina are continuous with the surrounding epidermis, and the cup thus formed remains
  widely opened to the cuticle in a few Polychaetes, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Autolytus</i>, and in the young
  of <i>Nereis</i>, but more usually it has the relations represented in the figure. The lens is
  produced by the retinal cells (according to Andrews<a id="NtA_310"
  href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a>), and is in some cases (<i>Eunice</i>, <i>Amphinome</i>)
  continuous with the cuticle. It appears to be composed in other cases (<i>Lepidonotus</i>) of
  continuations of the retinal rods. The structure of the other sense organs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page256"><span class="smaller">{256}</span></span>indicates their adaptation to a tactile
  function; in each case a nerve traverses the axis of the organ, and the nerve-fibrils terminate in
  sensory cells. Very probably the palps have a certain power of testing the food&mdash;a
  combination of the senses of taste and smell.</p>

  <p>The <b>Generative System</b>.&mdash;In all the Polychaeta, with very few exceptions, the sexes
  are separate; and the reproductive cells&mdash;ova and spermatozoa&mdash;are produced at certain
  seasons of the year by the rapid proliferation and modification of coelomic epithelial cells
  surrounding the blood-vessels in the parapodium and its immediate neighbourhood. The sexual cells
  remain in the coelom till they are ripe.</p>

  <p>The egg-cells become filled with yolk globules; a vitelline membrane is present, and an outer
  coat of albuminous material. It is doubtful by what means these sexual cells are discharged in
  <i>Nereis</i>. There is some evidence that the "dorsal ciliated organ" may act as a genital duct.
  In some other worms the nephridia serve this purpose, whilst in others a rupture of the body-wall
  allows the products to escape into the sea. According to Wistinghausen,<a id="NtA_311"
  href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> at the time of discharge the females of <i>Nereis
  dumerilii</i> become surrounded by a kind of gelatinous tube formed from a secretion of the
  parapodial glands, and into this tube the ova are discharged, and arranged in a single layer round
  its wall.</p>

  <p>The common species <i>Nereis diversicolor</i> is viviparous. In a large number of species of
  <i>Nereis</i> the sexually-mature individuals undergo very marked changes in various parts of
  their body, so that they differ very greatly from the immature individuals.</p>

  <p class="sp5">These changes resulting in the "heteronereid" condition will be dealt with at some
  length in Chap. X. p. <a href="#page276">276</a>. The larvae of Polychaetes and other facts
  connected with reproduction are described in the same chapter.</p>

  <p>The <b>Polychaeta</b> are marine worms whose bodies are usually elongated and cylindrical; they
  either lead a free life, swimming in the open sea, or crawling along the bottom; or they pass
  their life in burrows or definite tubes of various kinds.</p>

  <p>Each segment is normally provided on each side with a single or a couple of bundles of chaetae,
  by means of which locomotion is effected. These, in the free-living forms, are carried at the ends
  of lateral muscular outgrowths of the body, known as "parapodia," which are practically limbs.</p>

  <p>The "head" of the worm generally carries eyes, and frequently more or less elongated tactile
  organs, the "tentacles" dorsally and "palps" ventrally. The foregut is frequently provided with a
  masticating apparatus in its anterior region, which is capable of protrusion; but this apparatus
  is absent in many burrowing and tubicolous forms. The sexes are separate, so that there is no such
  complicated system of generative organs as occurs in the Oligochaeta. The nephridia usually act as
  genital ducts. In the majority of cases the egg develops into a larva, the "Trochosphere," which
  leads a free life and undergoes a greater or less metamorphosis into the adult condition.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Comparative Anatomy of the Polychaeta.</b></p>

  <p><b>General Shape of the Body.</b>&mdash;The majority of the Polychaeta have an elongated and
  very mobile body, like that of <i>Nereis</i>, consisting of an indefinite and usually of a
  considerable number of segments; a few, however, have a shorter body, with fewer segments,
  definite in number, for instance <i>Aphrodite</i> and <i>Polyno&euml;</i>, which have thirty to forty
  segments; and some Hesionids, with only some seventeen to twenty segments.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span class="smaller">{259}</span></span></div>

  <p>In Aphroditidae and certain Amphinomidae the body is more or less oval in shape. In
  <i>Lipobranchius</i> and <i>Sternaspis</i> it is grub-like, short, and cylindrical, with rounded
  ends; in the former it is difficult to distinguish head and tail, or dorsal and ventral
  surfaces.</p>

  <p>The segments composing the trunk may be all alike, or may constitute two more or less sharply
  marked regions, the <i>thorax</i> and <i>abdomen</i>, differing in the character of the chaetae,
  or in their arrangement, or in some other way, as in the Sabelliformia and the
  Capitelliformia.</p>

  <p>As peculiar cuticular structures, the curious shields of <i>Sternaspis</i>, and of certain of
  the Maldanidae may be mentioned.</p>

  <p>The posterior extremity is generally more or less narrowed, and most of the Nereidiformia are
  provided with special elongated cirri, borne by the anal segment. In the Maldanidae and others the
  body terminates in a funnel, at the bottom of which is placed the anus. Only in a few cases is the
  anus not terminal; in <i>Notopygos</i> and other Amphinomidae, as well as in some species of
  <i>Polyno&euml;</i>, it is dorsal.<a id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> In
  <i>Sabellaria</i> and <i>Pectinaria</i> the hinder end of the body undergoes great degeneration;
  in the former it is achaetous, but cylindrical and bent forwards alongside the body (Fig. 131). In
  <i>Pectinaria</i> (Fig. 177), this region, which is called the "scapha," is leaf-like, and serves
  to close the narrower end of the tube in which the worm lives. <i>Arenicola marina</i>, and some
  Terebellids have no chaetae in the hinder, narrower part of the body.</p>

  <p>The <b>Head</b>.&mdash;The prostomium is, in the majority of cases, rounded or conical, though
  it may be square (<i>Nephthys</i>) or elongated and jointed (<i>Glycera</i>), or even
  hammer-shaped (<i>Tomopteris</i>); or it may be fused with the peristomium, and apparently absent
  (<i>Arenicola</i>). In the great group Cryptocephala, the peristomium grows forwards so as to hide
  the prostomium entirely.</p>

  <p>In a few of the Nereidiformia the prostomium is compressed, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page260"><span class="smaller">{260}</span></span>and in the Amphinomidae it is provided with
  a dorsal ridge or "caruncle," which is a leaf-like process overlapping three or more segments. In
  many Aphroditidae (as well as in <i>Polydora</i>) there is a peculiar "frontal" ridge passing
  forwards from the prostomial tentacle, and downwards into the mouth (Figs. 132, <i>c</i>, and 133,
  A, <i>x</i>).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In all the Nereidiformia, as well as in Sabelliformia and Chlorhaemidae, the prostomium bears
  sensory processes of two kinds, viz. dorsal tentacles and ventral palps. The latter are invariably
  two in number, and are particularly well developed in Aphroditidae, Nereidae, Syllidae, some of
  the Eunicidae, and in Chlorhaemidae. Even when they are apparently absent, as in <i>Nephthys</i>,
  it is possible that they are represented by certain lobes at the sides of the mouth, for in many
  Syllidae they are so fused with the prostomium as to be scarcely distinguishable. In the
  Chlorhaemids the palps<a id="NtA_314" href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> are grooved, and in the
  Sabelliformia they become considerably branched, and extend round the prostomium so as to nearly
  meet dorsally and ventrally. Each palp is, in this sub-Order, represented by a greater or smaller
  number of long, mobile filaments, arising from a common base; they are grooved along the inner
  side, ciliated, and provided with secondary processes. The crown of "gills," in fact, is nothing
  <span class="pagenum" id="page261"><span class="smaller">{261}</span></span>more than the greatly
  subdivided and enormously elongated palps, as both Pruvot<a id="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> and Meyer<a id="NtA_316" href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a>
  have shown. In such forms as <i>Haplobranchus</i> and <i>Amphicorine</i> the process of
  subdivision (branching) has only gone a short way. In all the Sabelliformia each filament, in
  addition to its sensory function, aids in conveying food to the mouth by the action of the cilia,
  and has a blood-vessel within, thus acting as a respiratory organ. The filament may carry compound
  eyes (Fig. 143) either at its apex (<i>Branchiomma</i>) or at intervals along its course
  (<i>Dasychone</i>).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      following segments.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the family Serpulidae one (rarely two) of the most dorsally placed gill filaments is
  enlarged terminally, and acts as a stopper or "operculum," which closes the mouth of the tube when
  the animal withdraws into it. Further, in <i>Spirorbis</i> this operculum is grooved on one side,
  and serves as a brood pouch in which the eggs undergo development (Fig. 184, p. <a
  href="#page341">341</a>). It will be seen, therefore, that the palps may be very important organs
  for the life of the worm, and they are no less interesting to the comparative anatomist, serving
  as they do as an excellent illustration of the various uses which Nature finds for one and the
  same organ.</p>

  <p>In the other sub-Orders the prostomium carries neither palps nor tentacles.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <i>tentacles</i> in the Nereidiformia present a wide variation in number; probably the
  typical number is three, one of which is median and two lateral&mdash;as in Polynoids, Syllidae,
  and some Eunicidae. Further, there is a certain amount of evidence in the nerve supply of the
  median tentacle to show that it was originally double. The presence of four tentacles, then, as in
  <i>Nephthys</i>, <i>Phyllodoce</i>, and <i>Glycera</i>, may be a primitive condition. By the
  disappearance of the paired lateral tentacles the worm possesses a single median one, as in
  <i>Aphrodite</i> and Amphinomids;<a id="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> whilst a
  duplication of these lateral ones leads to the condition of <i>Eunice</i> and <i>Hyalinoecia</i>,
  which have five tentacles. In the Chlorhaemidae the number is further increased to five or more on
  each <span class="pagenum" id="page263"><span class="smaller">{263}</span></span>side,<a
  id="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> and in the Terebellidae these prostomial
  processes become very numerous.</p>

  <p>In the Cryptocephala there is never more than a single pair of tentacles, and these are
  generally reduced to a group of sensory cells, though in <i>Sabellaria</i> they retain a
  considerable size.</p>

  <p>In a few genera, such as <i>Aphrodite</i>, <i>Nephthys</i>, <i>Capitella</i>, the first
  postoral segment is distinguished from the succeeding segments only by its position with regard to
  the mouth (Fig. 132) and by its smaller size. But in the remainder of the Polychaeta, with here
  and there an exception, the peristomium is achaetous in the adult.<a id="NtA_319"
  href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Except in the Nereidiformia, peristomial or tentacular cirri are rare, being represented in the
  Spioniformia by the very long "tentacles." In the Nereidiformia one or more of the following
  segments may be added to the peristomium, and share in the "cephalisation," which is so
  characteristic a feature in this group. In Amphinomids the first three or four chaetigerous
  segments are incomplete ventrally, owing to the shifting of the mouth backwards; these segments
  form lateral lips, but they are not otherwise modified. In <i>Phyllodoce</i>, however, there are
  four cirri on each side of the mouth, and from the arrangement in the Alciopids we are justified
  in concluding that the segment which carries the four pairs of cirri is really made up of three
  segments (Fig. 134, E). Among the Hesionids there are four such "cephalised" achaetous segments
  with long cirri.</p>

  <p>In a few cases, such as the Chlorhaemids and <i>Sternaspis</i>, and to a slight degree in
  <i>Arenicola</i>, the "head" and even the anterior part of the worm is capable of being withdrawn
  into the body.</p>

  <p><b>The Parapodia and Chaetae.</b>&mdash;The typical parts of a parapodium have been described
  in the preceding chapter; here it is only necessary to refer to the series of diagrams (Figs. 136,
  137) representing the parapodia of the more common Polychaetes, and to add a few remarks about
  them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In most Annelids the chaetae are in two bundles on each side, but there are certain families in
  which the dorsal bundle, and even the notopodium itself, is absent, as in the Eunicidae, Syllidae,
  and Phyllodocidae; or the dorsal bundle may be absent only in certain regions of the body, as in
  the hind-body of Terebellids. In some Amphinomidae and Aphroditidae the notopodium is scarcely
  distinct as a separate lobe, being a slight tubercle on the upper surface of the neuropodium; but
  the notopodial chaetae are present, and indeed particularly well developed in many cases.</p>

  <p>But whilst, in the Nereidiformia, the parapodia, whether <span class="pagenum"
  id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span>consisting of two lobes or only one, are
  always well developed, and project to a more or less pronounced degree from the sides of the body,
  it is otherwise in the rest of the group, where the chaetigerous lobes are usually reduced to mere
  tubercles or ridges, no doubt in relation to their burrowing or tubicolous habits. In
  <i>Sternaspis</i> the chaetae issue directly from the body-wall.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Nereidiformia we find examples in which the parapodia, instead of being more or
  less conical "legs," are flattened fore and aft so as to serve as efficient "fins," as in the
  active swimmers, <i>Nereis virens</i> and <i>Nephthys caeca</i>, and in the pelagic Phyllodocids,
  Alciopids, Typhloscolecids, and <i>Tomopteris</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the typical dorsal and ventral cirri, the ventral is only absent in some Amphinomids amongst
  the Nereidiformia; the dorsal is absent in <i>Nephthys</i> and degenerate in <i>Glycera</i>,
  whilst in a very large number of families of the other sub-Orders neither cirrus is present. These
  cirri, though originally filamentous and sensory, may, by virtue of special blood supply, become
  "gills," and this occurs in several families of different sub-Orders. Thus in <i>Eunice</i> this
  gill is comb-like; in <i>Amphinome</i> and in <i>Arenicola</i> (on certain segments) it is
  arborescent, as it is also in one to three segments in Terebellids; whilst in Ariciidae,
  Spioniformia, Cirratulidae, Opheliidae, and <i>Sabellaria</i> it remains more or less
  finger-shaped or filamentous. In the family Serpulidae the thoracic cirri, both dorsal and
  ventral, <span class="pagenum" id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>become
  flattened and extended antero-posteriorly, and unite with one another to form the "thoracic
  membrane."<a id="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> In Phyllodocidae the cirri are
  foliaceous and natatory, and they contain a great quantity of glands of a peculiar character. The
  Aphroditidae are distinguished from other Annelids by the possession of "elytra" or dorsal scales,
  which appear to be the dorso-ventrally flattened cirri, retaining their sensory nature, but adding
  to this function several others.<a id="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>chaetae</b> or bristles are mainly used in locomotion, but it is not unreasonable to
  believe that some of the stronger, serrated kinds may be used as weapons of offence and defence;
  certainly the Polynoids, bristling as they do with stiff chaetae along each side, must be rather
  unpleasant to their smaller enemies.</p>

  <p>The various bristles may be placed in three chief groups, viz. (1) simple; (2) jointed; (3)
  uncini (see Fig. 138).</p>

  <p>(1) The simple chaetae may be smooth and hair-shaped, <i>i.e.</i> "capillary," such as are
  present in nearly all families: or they may be forked (Amphinomidae), comb-shaped (<i>Eunice</i>),
  notched or serrated, or provided with a series of frills at right angles to their length, as in
  Aphroditidae; or fringed along one or both sides with a membranous expansion, as in Terebellids
  and Sabellids.  The simple chaetae may also be short and spine-like, as in the ventral bundles of
  <i>Arenicola</i>; or they may be slightly curved at the end and notched, forming what are
  generally termed "crotchets," such as are common amongst Oligochaeta. These "crotchets" may be
  simple, or have numerous denticulations at the end (Maldanidae), or be provided with a membranous
  hood (Spioniformia, Capitelliformia).  In <i>Hermione</i> peculiar sheathed, spear-like bristles
  occur (Fig. 138, N).</p>

  <p>(2) Jointed chaetae have already been described (p. <a href="#page246">246</a>); they are
  confined to the sub-Order Nereidiformia, and occur only in certain families.</p>

  <p>(3) The uncini are very short chaetae, which are simply embedded in the skin, and do not extend
  beyond the body-wall into the body-cavity. An uncinus is a sharply curved hook, which may have
  more or less numerous secondary teeth on it. They are characteristic of the Sabelliformia and the
  Terebelliformia.</p>

  <p>The chaetae appear as solid, usually fibrillated structures, of a yellow or golden tint,
  transparent and refringent. Chemically <span class="pagenum" id="page267"><span
  class="smaller">{267}</span></span>they consist of <i>chitin</i>, and each chaeta is the product
  of a single cell. The chaetae of <i>Euphrosyne</i> are hollow and calcareous, being peculiar in
  both characters.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Certain modifications of the chaetae presented by various worms deserve mention. In
  <i>Polydora</i> (Fig. 133, A) and in <i>Chaetopterus</i> (Fig. 173, p. <a href="#page324">324</a>)
  those of one segment are especially strong, but their significance is uncertain. In
  <i>Capitella</i> those <span class="pagenum" id="page268"><span
  class="smaller">{268}</span></span>of the notopodium of the eighth and ninth segments are
  specially modified; they are analogous to the copulatory chaetae of Oligochaeta. In
  <i>Aphrodite</i>, in addition to the ordinary locomotor chaetae, there are brilliant, iridescent
  bristles and peculiar felting threads arising from the indistinct notopodium; these latter,
  however, are not true "chaetae," but are separate chitinous filaments similar to the constituent
  fibres of an ordinary chaeta.<a id="NtA_322" href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

  <p>While the chaetae in the Nereidiformia and others are grouped in bundles, those of many other
  families are in vertical, transverse rows, as in Maldanidae and in <i>Arenicola</i>. The uncini
  are always embedded in such rows, usually slightly raised from the general level of the body
  surface, each being termed a "torus uncinigerus." These tori are usually limited to the sides of
  the body, but in <i>Myxicola</i> and in <i>Notomastus</i> they encroach upon the dorsal surface,
  and in <i>Chaetozone</i>, also upon the ventral, so as nearly to encircle the body, recalling the
  "perichaetous" condition of some earth-worms.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Gills.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that several different organs, <i>e.g.</i> the palps
  in Sabelliformia, the prostomial tentacles of Chlorhaemidae, and the notopodial cirri of sundry
  other Polychaetes, may take on a respiratory function. There are, however, certain "gills"
  developed either on the parapodium itself or elsewhere on the body which it is difficult to
  homologise. Such are the <i>retractile gills</i> on the parapodia of the Glyceridae (Fig. 136, C);
  those of <i>Dasybranchus</i>, near the abdominal neuropodia; those of <i>Mastobranchus</i>, near
  the notopodia. <i>Nephthys</i> has a sickle-shaped gill on the under surface of the notopodium.
  The long gill filaments at the posterior end of <i>Sternaspis</i>, again, are only doubtfully
  interpreted as the dorsal cirri of some of the posterior segments.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page269"><span class="smaller">{269}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Since primitively the whole skin of the worm is respiratory, any part of the skin
  may become more or less specialised for this function, and chiefly, of course, on the more
  actively moving parapodia. The blood-vessels constituting the essential part of the "gill" may
  make use of any already existing outgrowth (such as a cirrus or a tentacle), or may push the
  body-wall out on their own account.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Internal Anatomy.</b></p>

  <p>Probably those organs which have the greatest effect in modifying the shape of the body are the
  <b>septa</b>, for we find in the long, free-swimming worms that these are regularly present
  throughout the body, and external "segmentation" of the body is well marked. In burrowing and
  tubicolous forms the septa are frequently incompletely developed, or more or fewer may be absent;
  and the body becomes less distinctly segmented externally, tends to vary greatly in diameter
  during movement, or becomes plumper. With the disappearance of the septa there is also a
  diminution in the number of <b>nephridia</b>, as in <i>Arenicola</i>, with only six pairs.
  Further, there is frequently a dimorphism of these organs; instead of all of them serving equally
  as excretory organs and as genital ducts, some of the most anterior in the Sabelliformia and
  Terebelliformia become greatly enlarged, and take on practically the whole of the former function;
  whilst more or fewer of the posterior nephridia dwindle in size, and become genital ducts. The
  absence of septa allows a free communication between the successive segments, and thus a freer
  flow of coelomic fluid for the distension of the anterior end of the worm during burrowing.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary system</b> presents certain modifications of a systematic value. In the
  Nereidiformia the muscular pharynx, which is always protrusible and is preceded by an eversible
  buccal region, frequently encloses thickened cuticular plates which serve as crushing and grasping
  organs. The form, number, and arrangement of these "jaws" vary in the different families. They
  form valuable fossil records of extinct worms.</p>

  <p>In the Scoleciformia and Capitelliformia the buccal region exists, but there are no jaws. In
  the Sabelliformia and Terebelliformia eversion does not take place and jaws are absent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page270"><span class="smaller">{270}</span></span></div>

  <p>Amongst the Nereidiformia the jaws are absent in the Phyllodocidae and Hesionidae; when present
  they are usually set in the direct course of the food. There may be one small tooth used for
  stabbing, as in some Syllids (Fig. 141, A); or a circle of such denticles (<i>Autolytus</i>, Fig.
  140, D). To these are added powerful grasping jaws in <i>Nereis</i> (E); or the latter may alone
  be present, as in <i>Glycera</i> (F). In <i>Polyno&euml;</i> the four jaws are carried by hard pieces,
  to which the muscles are attached (C and G). In <i>Nephthys</i> there is a dorsal and a ventral
  jaw.</p>

  <p>In the Eunicidae, however, the numerous denticles are carried in a special pouch below the food
  tract, with which it communicates anteriorly.<a id="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a>
  They are arranged in an upper and lower series. The lower series (L) consists of a pair of flat
  plates (<i>k</i>) on each side partially embedded in and acted upon by muscles, with a harder
  enamelled piece&mdash;the actual lower "tooth" (<i>j</i>)&mdash;at its anterior end. The upper
  series (U) consists of several pieces, varying in shape and size in the various genera of this
  <span class="pagenum" id="page271"><span class="smaller">{271}</span></span>family; but
  developmentally they result from modifications of two rows of small, similar pieces.<a
  id="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <i>intestine</i> is generally straight and cylindrical, and is usually constricted by the
  septa, if these are present. In the Polynoids the intervening sacculations become so long as to
  receive the name of "caeca," which, in <i>Aphrodite</i>, become enormously elongated (Fig. 142);
  there are eighteen pairs of them (<i>c</i>), each being a slender tube bent upon itself, giving
  off short branches and dilated distally, where it lies in the base of the parapodium.</p>

  <p>The intestine is looped in a few genera only, as in <i>Trophonia</i>, or coiled, as in
  <i>Sternaspis</i>, <i>Petta</i> (Amphictenid, Fig. 141, C), and <i>Ammotrypane</i>. In the course
  of the tube there may be a thick-walled muscular <i>gizzard</i>, with hard chitinous lining, as in
  certain Terebellids, where it appears to replace, in function, the pharynx of the Nereidiformia;
  in the Syllidae the gizzard is present in addition to the pharynx (Fig. 141, A).</p>

  <p>Glandular appendages of the oesophagus are present in many <span class="pagenum"
  id="page272"><span class="smaller">{272}</span></span>worms. Amongst the Nereidiformia, the
  Syllidae and Hesionidae possess oesophageal diverticula (Fig. 141, A, <i>d</i>), which are used,
  not for secreting a digestive fluid, but as reservoirs for water and air swallowed by the worms;
  and are provided with muscular walls, by which their contents can be driven out. They appear, in
  fact, to be used like the swim-bladder of fishes.<a id="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> Many Chaetopods take in water by the anus&mdash;no doubt for
  respiratory purposes&mdash;and pass it forwards along the intestine. In the Capitelliformia a
  special groove conducts the water for some distance, then the groove becomes closed to form a
  canal, which, after a course forwards as a free tube below the intestine, again enters the latter,
  constituting a "siphonal apparatus," similar to that of the Echiuroids and the sea urchins.</p>

  <p><b>Sense Organs.</b>&mdash;In addition to the prostomial <i>eyes</i>, which are present in
  nearly all the Nereidiformia and Spioniformia, eyes may exist elsewhere on the body: thus
  <i>Myxicola infundibulum</i> and <i>Fabricia</i> possess a pair on the anal segment; in <i>M.
  aesthetica</i> Clap. there is a pair to every segment; in <i>Branchiomma</i> there is a compound
  eye near the tip of each gill filament (<i>i.e.</i> palp); whilst in <i>Dasychone</i> a series
  occurs along each gill filament. All these examples belong to the Cryptocephala, in which, owing
  to certain peculiar modes of life, these sense organs are required in correspondingly peculiar
  positions. It is usually stated that <i>Polyophthalmus</i> possesses, in addition to the usual
  prostomial eyes, twelve pairs on as many successive segments; but the minute structure of these
  organs points rather to their function as light-producing organs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Capitelliformia and Opheliidae possess a pair of peculiar "ciliated pits" or "nuchal
  organs" at the upper side of the head, <span class="pagenum" id="page273"><span
  class="smaller">{273}</span></span>between the prostomium and peristomium, and capable of eversion
  (Fig. 144). They are most characteristically developed in the Capitelliformia, where each organ
  abuts upon a special lobe of the brain.  The function of these "ciliated organs," which bear a
  great resemblance to those of the Nemertines, is a matter of speculation.  Similar organs, in the
  form of simple pits or grooves, occur in many of the Nereidiformia, Terebelliformia, and others.<a
  id="NtA_326" href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Otocysts are rare. <i>Arenicola</i> possesses a pair at the base of the prostomium, each of
  which in some species retains an opening to the exterior.<a id="NtA_327"
  href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> They probably serve as "organs of direction" rather than of
  "hearing." <i>Aricia</i> and <i>Polyophthalmus</i> likewise have such organs on the prostomium;
  whilst <i>Fabricia</i>, <i>Myxicola</i>, <i>Terebella</i>, and a few others possess them in the
  peristomium, or in some other segment of the body.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Reproductive Phenomena.</b>&mdash;With a few exceptions mentioned below, the Polychaeta are
  unisexual. The sexual cells are developed in all cases from the lining epithelium of the
  body-cavity. The exact spot at which this occurs varies in different cases; it may be, though
  rarely, on the floor of the body-cavity; it is more usually on the wall of some blood-vessel,
  either the ventral vessel or on branches of it; or on the many blind blood-vessels of
  <i>Aphrodite</i>. The number of such genital organs is very great in most worms, but in those
  presenting two regions of the body they are confined to the posterior segments (Sabelliformia,
  Terebelliformia, Capitelliformia). The number is very limited in <i>Arenicola</i> and other worms
  presenting but few nephridia: in the former genus there being six pairs, in <i>Trophonia</i> only
  one pair.</p>

  <p>The following genera are hermaphrodite:&mdash;<i>Amphiglena</i>, <i>Salmacina</i>,
  <i>Protula</i>, <i>Spirorbis</i>, belonging to the Sabelliformia, to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page274"><span class="smaller">{274}</span></span>which must be added some Hesionidae. In this
  family ova and spermatozoa are developed around the same blood-vessel. But in the former group of
  worms (as also in <i>Ophryotrocha</i>) the two kinds of cells are produced in different regions of
  the body. Thus in <i>Protula</i> the anterior abdominal segments are male, the posterior ones
  female, while in <i>Spirorbis</i> the reverse arrangement holds; and in <i>Syllis corruscans</i>
  the anterior segments of the body contain eggs, whilst the posterior region contains spermatozoa,
  and this region separates and becomes a male worm.</p>

  <p>The eggs and spermatozoa in the Polychaeta are discharged into the sea either by rupture of the
  body-wall or through the nephridia; the male and female elements unite, and the resulting
  fertilised eggs undergo development, either floating separately in the water, or embedded in
  jelly, or attached to the body or to the tube of the worm.</p>

  <p>The result of the segmentation of the egg is a free-swimming larva known as a "Trochosphere,"
  similar to that of <i>Polygordius</i>. The larvae of different species present various more or
  less marked departures from this type, for instead of the two girdles of cilia there may be only
  the anterior girdle, or there may be several complete or incomplete girdles between the two
  typical ones, or there may be (Chaetopterids) only a single girdle of cilia about the middle of
  the body, the two typical girdles being absent.<a id="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a>
  The postoral region, after elongation, generally becomes marked out into three segments, and these
  segments develop chaetae, which are usually temporary and specially long.</p>

  <p>The little animal is thus equipped for an independent life: the provisional chaetae help in
  keeping it balanced; and in some cases (Spionidae) serve to protect the little soft creature, for
  when it is touched it curls up, and its chaetae stick out at the sides, so that it looks like a
  hairy caterpillar. But the larva is quite at the mercy of the sea, for it is carried hither and
  thither by currents, and in this way the species is disseminated. The larvae of the Polychaetes,
  like those of other animals, occur at certain periods of the year in large quantities at the
  surface of the sea, and serve as food for various larger animals.</p>

  <p>These larvae are at first very different from the adult animal, and the necessary changes to be
  passed through are more or less great according to the species. It is not our intention to
  describe these changes in detail.<a id="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> The larva
  increases in size, the permanent chaetae make their appearance in regular order, and the body
  exhibits segmentation, the new segments always appearing just in front of the anal segment. The
  internal organs gradually develop, and the prostomial and parapodial appendages grow out in their
  turn. In the Sabelliformia the multifilamentous "gills" arise by the continued branching of an at
  first simple process (the palp) arising from the latero-ventral surface of each side of the
  preoral lobe.<a id="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> These gradually encroach dorsally
  and ventrally till the prostomium is more or less encircled; meanwhile the peristomium grows
  forwards so as to conceal the prostomium, which no longer increases at the same rate as does the
  rest of the body.</p>

  <p>Although most worms appear to discharge their ova directly into the sea and take no further
  care of them, some make provision for their offspring either by laying the eggs in a jelly, which
  will serve as food for the young larvae&mdash;<i>Aricia</i>, <i>Ophelia</i>, <i>Protula</i>,
  <i>Phyllodoce</i>&mdash;or by attaching them to their body. In certain Polynoids the eggs are
  attached by means of a secretion to the back, under the elytra, where they undergo development up
  to a certain stage. In <i>Exogone</i> and some other Syllids they are attached to the ventral
  cirri, or in <i>Grubea limbata</i>, all over the back. In the female <i>Autolytus</i>
  (<i>Sacconereis</i>) a ventrally-placed brood sac is formed by the hardening of a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page276"><span class="smaller">{276}</span></span>secretion; the eggs develop
  into embryos inside the brood sac, and then become free, with head appendages and three pairs of
  parapodia. Enormous numbers of such embryos may occur; for instance, some 300 were counted in a
  brood sac of <i>Autolytus ebiensis</i>. In the case of tubicolous worms, the eggs are frequently
  attached to the tube, either inside or outside. In <i>Spirorbis</i> and <i>Salmacina</i> the
  operculum serves as a brood pouch.</p>

  <p>Only a very few species are known to be viviparous, viz. <i>Syllis vivipara</i> Kr.,
  <i>Cirratulus chrysoderma</i> Clap., <i>Marphysa sanguinea</i> Mont., and <i>Nereis
  diversicolor</i> M&uuml;ll.</p>

  <p>In most genera there is no external difference between a mature worm filled with generative
  products and an immature one, except, it may be, in the colour; for the yolk of the eggs is
  frequently tinted yellow, or pink, or bluish, while the spermatozoa in mass are white; so that the
  normal colouring of the worm may be modified when filled with these elements. But in a few
  instances striking anatomical peculiarities are exhibited by the mature worm.<a id="NtA_331"
  href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> In many species of <i>Nereis</i>, for instance, those segments
  containing the generative products undergo more or less extensive changes, while the anterior ones
  remain unaltered. The body of the ripe <i>Nereis</i> is then distinguishable into an anterior
  non-sexual region and a posterior sexual region; and so great are these changes in certain species
  that the mature worms were for a long time believed to belong to a different genus, and received
  the name <i>Heteronereis</i>. But we now know their true relations, thanks to the work of
  Clapar&egrave;de and others. The males in the Heteronereid phase have fewer unaltered anterior segments
  than the females, so that there is a sexual dimorphism.</p>

  <p>The changes which <i>Nereis</i> undergoes in its transformation affect chiefly (<i>a</i>) the
  shape of the parapodia, and (<i>b</i>) the form of the chaetae of these parapodia. Other organs
  may also be affected, though less noticeably; thus the eyes become enlarged, the intestine may
  become so compressed by the generative <span class="pagenum" id="page277"><span
  class="smaller">{277}</span></span>products as to be functionless, and the tail develops special
  sensory papillae.<a id="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the parapodia an increase in size and a sharper delineation of the various parts take place;
  then flattened foliaceous outgrowths (Fig. 147, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) arise from certain lobes of
  the feet, in which, too, the blood supply becomes greatly increased. The old chaetae are pushed
  out by the development of new ones of quite a different shape; these are jointed like the old
  ones, but the appendix is, in many species at least, flattened and oar-shaped (Fig. 123, C, p. <a
  href="#page246">246</a>); and the chaetae are arranged in a fan-like manner. Both these
  modifications are in evident relation to the free-swimming habit which the Heteronereid now
  adopts. The new foot serves as a swimming organ, the old one was a walking appendage.</p>

  <p>Whilst some species, such as the common British <i>N. diversicolor</i>, undergo no change, and
  others become modified as just described, others, again, are polymorphic. Clapar&egrave;de was the first
  to show that <i>N. dumerilii</i> may occur in at least five different mature forms; these differ
  from one another in size, colour, mode of life, character of the eggs, etc. The immature forms may
  become ripe and lay eggs while still retaining the "Nereid" characteristics, or these immature
  forms may become "Heteronereids"<a id="NtA_333" href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> whilst the
  sexual elements are ripening. There are then three different kinds of males and of females in this
  one species, some being found at the bottom of the sea, as the large Heteronereid form, while the
  small Heteronereid swims on the surface. The relations of these various forms to one another, and
  the causes leading to the <span class="pagenum" id="page278"><span
  class="smaller">{278}</span></span>assumption of a Heteronereid condition in some cases and not in
  others, are unknown.</p>

  <p>A somewhat similar phenomenon is exhibited by members of the family Syllidae.<a id="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> In this family sexual reproduction is frequently accompanied
  by the asexual modes of fission and gemmation. In some genera, such as <i>Eusyllis</i>,
  <i>Odontosyllis</i>, and <i>Exogone</i>, there occur changes quite similar to those characterising
  "Heteronereis"&mdash;that is, the posterior segments in which the genital organs exist become
  altered, so that the worm consists of two distinct regions, and is termed a "Heterosyllis." The
  most marked change is the appearance of a dorsal bundle of long capilliform chaetae in each of the
  genital segments (Fig. 148, I).</p>

  <p>But in other genera the hinder genital region of the body becomes <i>separated</i>, on
  maturity, from the anterior non-sexual region. Various stages of this "schizogamy," or fission
  into a sexual and a non-sexual zooid, have been observed in different genera. In the genus
  <i>Syllis</i> the first segment of the sexual zooid, after its separation from the asexual zooid,
  proceeds to bud forth a head. The character of the head is alike in both sexes, though different
  species present heads of different shapes; and as the worms were originally described as distinct
  genera, the names then given are retained as descriptive terms. Thus the "Chaetosyllis" form has
  only two tentacles; the "Ioda" form has three tentacles and a pair of palps. One and the same
  species (e.g. <i>S. hyalina</i>) may successively pass through these stages.</p>

  <p>With regard to the asexual portion, there is a regeneration of the tail segments after the
  sexual zooid has separated; and the number of segments so regenerated is usually equal to those
  that have become sexual. After a time these newly formed segments will produce generative organs,
  and take on the characteristic natatory chaetae, and this region will in its turn separate.</p>

  <p>But in other genera, such as <i>Autolytus</i>, the regeneration of segments may commence
  <i>before</i> the separation of the sexual zooid; and the head of the sexual zooid becomes budded
  out <i>before</i> separation from the asexual portion. So that the animal now consists of two
  worms, each with its own head, separated by <span class="pagenum" id="page279"><span
  class="smaller">{279}</span></span>a region or zone of proliferation (Fig. 148, IV). Moreover, in
  some species not only is the hinder part of the body <i>converted</i> into a sexual zooid, but the
  zone of proliferation becomes very active, and produces by gemmation a large number of segments,
  which become marked out, by the appearance of heads at intervals, into a number of zooids, in
  which genital organs will later make their appearance. A chain of as many as sixteen zooids may be
  formed in <i>Autolytus</i> (Fig. 148, V)&mdash;the hindermost by <i>conversion</i> of the hinder
  part of the body of the original "stock," the intervening zooids by <i>gemmation</i>.</p>

      separation.</p>
      <p>IV, <i>Autolytus</i>, etc. A zone of budding (<i>z</i>) makes its appearance in front of

      middle of the body.</p>
      <p class="sp0">V, <i>Myrianida</i>, <i>Autolytus</i>, etc. From this zone of budding a very
      large number of segments have been formed, which have, further, become grouped so as to form
      three individuals, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; <b>B</b> is the hindmost zooid, which is
      either formed from the hinder segments of the parent zooid or is produced by budding, like
      <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One original "stock," or asexual zooid, thus produces several sexual zooids, but these are only
  of one sex for a given stock. The males differ in several important characters from the females;
  so different, indeed, are the two sexes that before their history was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page280"><span class="smaller">{280}</span></span>worked out by Agassiz<a id="NtA_335"
  href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> they were placed in different genera. The male zooid has thus
  come to be known as <i>Polybostrichus</i> (Fig. 149, B). It has three tentacles and two bifid
  palps; there are two pairs of peristomial cirri; the testes are confined to the four anterior
  segments, which are without natatory chaetae. The female is termed <i>Sacconereis</i>, owing to
  the possession of a great ventral brood sac; its head possesses no separate palps; the peristomium
  carries only one cirrus on each side; ova occur in every segment of the body, and may even extend
  into the hinder segments of the asexual zooid (Fig. 149, C).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      palps fused with the prostomium; <i>s</i>, the ventral brood pouch projecting on each side;
      <i>t</i>, tentacles.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A further development of this process of gemmiparity is exhibited by <i>Myrianida</i>. Here,
  there is no conversion of the hinder segments, but the normal preanal zone of proliferation gives
  rise to a large number of new segments. After a time the most anterior of these becomes a head,
  and thus a new zooid <span class="pagenum" id="page281"><span
  class="smaller">{281}</span></span>is marked out. The zone of proliferation immediately in front
  of the new head now proceeds to form new segments, and a second zooid results. This process goes
  on till a considerable number of new worms have been formed at the tail of the original one, the
  oldest of these new ones being the most posterior, the youngest next the original "stock." In each
  zooid there is a zone of activity which adds to its number of segments, so that as we pass
  backwards the zooids increase in size. As many as twenty-nine such zooids may be formed in this
  way entirely by gemmation; and as each zooid becomes completed, genital organs make their
  appearance, and when these are ripe the zooid separates from the "colony" and leads an independent
  life. Here, as in <i>Autolytus</i>, the sexes are dimorphic, the male and female resembling those
  of that genus.</p>

  <p>The process of gemmation, as seen in <i>Autolytus</i>, closely resembles that exhibited by
  certain Oligochaeta (<i>Naididae</i>), where there exists a definite alternation of generations;
  the production of new individuals by gemmation occurring throughout the greater part of the year,
  and sexual reproduction recurring only at certain intervals. In the Polychaeta such alternation
  exists in <i>Myrianida</i>; but it is only the terminal link of a series, which takes its
  starting-point in the process exhibited by the majority of Annelids, where no sexual character
  marks maturity. The next stage is presented by "epigamous" forms like Heteronereis and
  Heterosyllis; then "schizogamy" makes its appearance in certain Syllidae, resulting in the
  formation of two morphologically and physiologically distinct individuals which lead independent
  lives. The appearance of a head and of a zone of proliferation leading to the formation of a chain
  of sexual zooids is accompanied by a delay in the appearance of the genital organs, for in
  <i>Autolytus</i> these arise <i>during</i> the formation of the new individuals, as part of the
  general process of new formation; whilst in <i>Myrianida</i> the delay is prolonged, and the
  generative elements do not make their appearance till <i>after</i> the new individuals have
  reached some size.</p>

  <p>More simple cases of the separation of the body into two parts, sexual and asexual, occur also
  in some of the Serpulidae. Thus in <i>Filigrana</i> and <i>Salmacina</i> the generative elements
  make their appearance in the hinder segments, as they do throughout the Sabelliformia; and this
  hinder part of the body separates <span class="pagenum" id="page282"><span
  class="smaller">{282}</span></span>from the anterior region after the formation of a new head
  between the two regions.<a id="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another modification of the process of budding and fission is exhibited by <i>Syllis
  ramosa</i>, one of the most interesting forms of animal life which was obtained by the
  "Challenger." This worm consists of a main stem, whence arise a number of lateral branches, which
  may also branch so as to give rise to an arborescent colony (Fig. 150). The branches of the first
  and second and higher orders arise by budding from the sides of the original form or branches of
  lower order; and some of these branches develop generative products, and bud forth a head near the
  point of attachment. These sexual branches, no doubt, separate from the colony and distribute the
  ova. The worm lives in a Hexactinellid sponge, <i>Crateromorpha meyeri</i>, living in depths of 95
  to 140 fathoms in the Eastern seas.<a id="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Regeneration of lost Parts.</b>&mdash;The process of budding and fission of the worm into
  two parts is merely an extension of that resulting in the formation of new segments when the worm
  is injured. In most of the Nereidiform Polychaetes the number of segments forming the body
  continues to increase throughout life by the formation of new segments between the anal segment
  and the one in front of it; that is to say, there is normally a process of budding taking place at
  this point. Now in many of the longer worms it may be noticed that the segments of the hinder end
  suddenly become smaller than the rest; these are segments newly formed to replace those lost by
  the worm. But this "regeneration," though the same in principle as ordinary growth <span
  class="pagenum" id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span>at the penultimate segment,
  is due to activity in a segment (any segment) further forwards; in other words, in the less
  modified worms every segment has the power of forming new tissues, just as each of the joints of a
  crab's leg has the power of forming the remaining joints when injured. It is not therefore
  surprising that a "zone of budding" arises in an uninjured worm at certain seasons, viz. that of
  reproduction; it is a property that each worm possesses, though generally it remains latent till
  injury provides the stimulus.</p>

  <p>Moreover, not only can new segments arise at the hinder end, but a new head can be formed at
  the anterior end, as has been observed in worms belonging to many families&mdash;in the less
  modified Syllidae,<a id="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> in others of the
  Nereidiformia, and even in Sabellids, where the greatly specialised gill filaments can be
  reproduced. Thus Sir J. Dalyell<a id="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> noted in
  <i>Dasychone</i> that the crown of branchiae was regenerated in about a month in springtime, while
  in winter the process occupied 116 days. He cut a <i>Dasychone</i> into three pieces; the
  hindermost produced a head, the anterior piece developed an anus, and the middle portion formed
  both a head and tail!</p>

  <p class="sp5">These regenerated heads are of course at first smaller than the rest of the body,
  but soon grow to a normal size. Naturally this extensive power of regeneration is of extreme value
  to the Polychaetes, for if a fish or other enemy bites the head off a worm, a new one can form;
  and it is not difficult to see in this the origin of the reproduction by fission as a normal
  process.</p>

  <p>All the many hundreds of species of Polychaetes are marine, with a very few exceptions, which
  have been in recent years recorded from fresh (<i>i.e.</i> drinkable) water, viz. a species of
  <i>Nereis</i> from a lake in Mingrelia, another <i>Nereis</i> and a <i>Lumbriconereis</i> from
  running water in Trinidad,<a id="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> a Sabellid,
  <i>Manayunkia speciosa</i>,<a id="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> from Philadelphia;
  and another Sabellid, <i>Coabangia</i>,<a id="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> from
  fresh water at Tonquin, which lives in borings in shells of <i>Melania</i>; and it is by no means
  improbable that other fresh-water Polychaetes exist in Lake Tanganyika in Africa, where a Medusa
  has recently been discovered.</p>

  <p>In brackish water of various densities many Polychaetes live; <i>Arenicola</i> especially is
  regardless of the character of the medium, and <i>Nereis diversicolor</i> appears to withstand
  considerable admixture of fresh water.</p>

  <p>The majority of the Polychaetes occur "inshore," that is, between tide-marks and in shallow
  water down to 20 fathoms; but they occur at all depths more or less abundantly, and some have been
  dredged from depths of more than 3000 fathoms.</p>

  <p>The nature of the soil composing the shore has a good deal to do with the number of worms to be
  found there; thus in calcareous districts they are fewer than in places where harder rocks, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page285"><span class="smaller">{285}</span></span>such as granite, form the
  shore line, for the chalk or limestone wears away more quickly, and exposes to destruction the
  worms which may have sheltered in its crevices: further, it does not give so permanent a place of
  attachment to seaweeds, on which many Polychaetes feed. The calcareous rocks, too, are more likely
  to be traversed by springs of fresh water, which is not to the taste of the worms. The sand
  resulting from the destruction of the rocks, whether hard or soft, is of itself unsuitable to the
  majority of worms, which are most abundant where mud containing decaying vegetable matter is mixed
  with the sand: this, which gives a firmer consistency to the soil, so that the burrows retain
  their form better, supplies food for the burrowers.</p>

  <p><b>General Habits.</b>&mdash;The division of the Polychaetes into the "Errantia" or
  free-swimming and wandering forms, and "Sedentaria" or tubicolous and sedentary forms, is a
  misleading mode of classification, for as a matter of fact only a comparatively few forms are
  really free-swimming throughout life; the majority, even if they do not form definite tubes,
  burrow galleries for themselves in the soil, and these burrows are in many cases only rarely left;
  this is true of both groups. Amongst the "errant" Polychaetes nearly all the Eunicidae secrete a
  parchment-like tube, and some Polynoids form mud tubes. Among the "sedentary worms" there are
  forms which merely burrow; while <i>Myxicola</i> readily leaves its gelatinous tube and swims
  freely; <i>Pectinaria</i> carries its house with it as it moves about, and <i>Polycirrus</i>, a
  Terebellid, does not form any tube at all.</p>

  <p>Owing to their sedentary habits, quite a representative collection of genera may be made,
  especially at a spring tide, at any seaside place which is provided with a sandy shore, and with
  rocks and seaweed. The larger species, however, require to be dredged, and the best time is at
  night, for then many forms which during the day are concealed in their burrows, will be issuing
  forth to obtain food.</p>

  <p>It may be useful to give instances of worms occurring in various situations between tide-marks.
  Throughout pretty well the whole of the area left uncovered by the tide, even up to nearly
  high-water mark in many parts of the coast, the cylindrical "castings" of sand and mud, forming
  little heaps, indicate the burrows of <i>Arenicola</i>, the common "lug-worm"; these "castings"
  have passed through the worm's body, having been <span class="pagenum" id="page286"><span
  class="smaller">{286}</span></span>swallowed during the process of burrowing as well as for the
  purpose of obtaining food, as in the case of the earthworms. Rather nearer the water may be seen
  little tufts of sand-threads, about an inch high, springing from a short piece of cylindrical,
  sandy tube rising up out of the sand; this is the head end of the tube of <i>Terebella
  conchilega</i> (Fig. 153).</p>

  <p>Amongst the rocks may be found loose stones of different sizes; on lifting them up, various
  kinds of worms may be brought to light, according to the locality, the time of year, the position
  with respect to the sea, and so on. <i>Polyno&euml;</i> is pretty sure to be present somewhere near
  low-tide mark; the number of species is considerable, and their colouring very varied: but as the
  worms have a habit of remaining still on the under surface of the uplifted stone, the observer may
  easily overlook them.</p>

  <p>Other worms occur below the stones, more or less buried in the sand or mud; for instance, a
  small <i>Nereis</i> may be lying in its temporary burrow immediately underneath, and will at once
  withdraw from the now injured part of the burrow; while deeper in the mud or sand, especially in
  rather highly-smelling mud, little red worms are abundant, such as <i>Scoloplos</i>,
  <i>Nerine</i>, <i>Capitella</i>, and others. By digging near low water one may find
  <i>Nephthys</i>, <i>Glycera</i>, and others burrowing or hiding in the soil.</p>

  <p>In rock pools, or sandy stretches amongst rocks kept moist and cool by abundant <i>Fucus</i>,
  one may see under stones the red or yellow gill filaments of <i>Cirratulus</i> and of Terebellids
  protruding from their burrows and tubes, while other worms are to be met with in clefts of the
  rocks, and amongst the roots of <i>Laminaria</i>.</p>

  <p>Still farther out, below low-water mark, where one must wade, can be seen the beautiful
  branchial crowns of various Sabellids protruding from their tubes; but care is necessary on
  approaching these worms, as eyes are, in many cases, present on the branchiae and a shadow is
  readily perceived; then the brightly-coloured tuft disappears, and only a piece of sandy or muddy
  cylindrical tubing remains to tell where the <i>Sabella</i> has withdrawn. In order to obtain the
  worms one must dig quickly and deeply before they have been disturbed; for the tube is of
  considerable length, and the inhabitant withdraws to the bottom of it. Some of these soft-skinned
  worms have the power of boring into hard rocks,<a id="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a>
  though by what means they do so is <span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span
  class="smaller">{287}</span></span>uncertain.<a id="NtA_344" href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a>
  <i>Polydora ciliata</i> makes a tube of mud projecting from the mouth of <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped galleries in chalk, limestone, shells, and even shale; it has no hard jaws or
  other structures sufficient to account for the holes, but it is possible that the specially strong
  chaetae on the sixth segment may be of some use in this work. Other lithodomous worms are
  <i>Sabella saxicava</i> and <i>Dodecaceria concharum</i>, which is a common little borer, forming
  galleries in oyster-shells, etc.</p>

  <p>The <b>tubes</b> formed by these Polychaetes are very varied in constitution.<a id="NtA_345"
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> In some cases a mucus, which hardens to form a firm protective
  envelope, is secreted from special parts (<i>e.g.</i> the ventral gland shields of Terebellids and
  Sabelliformia), or from the greater part of the general surface of the body; in other cases the
  secretion serves to stick together particles of mud or sand, or shelly fragments, so as to form a
  more or less cylindrical tube (rarely branched), which is lined internally by the hardened
  "mucus," having the appearance of silk.</p>

  </div>

  <p>But the process of tube-making is not a simple one, for in many cases, at least, the worms
  exhibit definite powers of choice. Thus some species of <i>Sabella</i> choose only the very finest
  particles of mud; <i>Terebella conchilega</i> chooses fragments of shell and grains of sand;
  <i>Onuphis conchylega</i> employs small stones more or less of a size; <i>Sabellaria</i> makes use
  only of sand grains. Whilst some worms, like <i>Terebella</i>, <i>Nicomache</i>, and others, make
  a very irregular tube, <i>Pectinaria</i> builds a most remarkably neat house, open at each end,
  which it carries about with it, the narrow end uppermost (Fig. 152); the grains of sand are nearly
  all of the same size and only one layer in thickness, embedded in abundant "mucus," and with the
  outer surface quite smooth.</p>

  <p>Sir J. Dalyell<a id="NtA_346" href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> made some most interesting

  <p>"Let a tall and ample crystal jar containing a <i>Sabella</i> be emptied of its contents and
  speedily replenished with sea-water; the animal, if in view, has retreated during the short
  interval; the orifice of the tube is closed, all is at rest. But soon after <span class="pagenum"
  id="page289"><span class="smaller">{289}</span></span>replenishment it rises, to display its
  branchial plume still more vigorously than before, and remains stationary, as if enjoying the
  freshness of the renovated element, always so grateful&mdash;the harbinger of health and strength
  to those whose dwelling is there. The passing spectator would conclude that he now beholds only a
  beautiful flower, completely expanded, inclining towards the light like some of those ornaments of
  nature decorating our gardens. He pauses in admiration. But if a drop of liquid mud falls amidst
  the element from above, disturbing its purity, then, while the plume unfolds to its utmost
  capacity, does the animal commence a slow revolution, the body also passing around within the
  tube. Now are the thousands of cilia fringing the ribs [<i>i.e.</i> the secondary filaments] of
  the branchiae discovered to be in vigorous activity, and their office to be wondrous. A loose
  muddy mass is soon afterwards visibly accumulating in the bottom of the funnel; meantime the neck
  or first segment of the body, rising unusually high above the orifice of the tube, exhibits two
  trowels beating down the thin edge as they fold and clasp over the margin, like our fingers
  pressing a flattened cake against the palm of the hand. [This refers to the lappets of the
  peristomial collar.] During these operations muddy collections are seen descending between the
  roots of the fans [right and left gills] towards the trowels, while another organ, perhaps the
  mouth, is also occupied, it may be, in compounding the preparation with adhesive matter. Still
  does the partial or complete revolution of the plume above, and of the body within the tube,
  continue; the bulk of the muddy mass diminishes, activity abates; it is succeeded by repose, when
  the tube is found to have received evident prolongation."</p>

  These particles are actually taken into the mouth, and mixed with some sort of secretion; on

  tube, and by means of its lower lip the Terebellid works it into place.<a id="NtA_347"
  href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But whereas the greater number of tubicolous worms make use of adventitious material wherewith
  to strengthen the wall of their tube, the Serpulidae secrete carbonate of lime from their
  tube-glands, and mould a tube of this substance. Amongst the Eunicidae the secreted substance is
  of itself strong enough to protect the animal; for in <i>Hyalinoecia</i> and species of
  <i>Eunice</i> the tube consists of a translucent, tough, parchment-like material.</p>

  <p>Chemical analysis has been employed in a few cases to determine the substance composing the
  tube. In the case of <i>Hyalinoecia</i> (sometimes erroneously called <i>Onuphis</i>) the material
  consists of a phosphoric salt containing magnesia and a characteristic organic substance
  "onuphin"<a id="NtA_348" href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a>; in <i>Spirographis</i>, a Sabellid,

  <p>The majority of worms are solitary, but there are a few instances of social worms&mdash;not
  that there is any co-operation or distribution of labour amongst the individuals, but they merely
  occur together in quantities; thus the sandy tubes of <i>Sabellaria</i> may form compact masses of
  several cubic feet, which, left uncovered by the receding tide, look like rocks upon the shore;
  as, for instance, at Paignton and Torquay. <i>Filigrana implexa</i> and <i>Serpula uncinata</i>
  similarly intertwine their calcareous tubes to form masses.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span class="smaller">{291}</span></span></div>

  <p>Whereas most worms live at the bottom of the sea, at various depths, a few are to be found at
  the surface. Purely pelagic habits are confined to a few families, viz. Tomopteridae,
  Typhloscolecidae, and the Alciopids and others amongst the Phyllodocidae; though
  <i>Nectochaeta</i>, one of the Polynoidae, and <i>Ophryotrocha</i>, one of the Eunicidae, are
  modified for this mode of life.<a id="NtA_349" href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> Several genera
  become pelagic during the breeding season. All these forms are excellent swimmers, and many of
  them are transparent.</p>

  <p>The <b>Colouring of Polychaetes</b>.&mdash;The majority of Polychaetes quickly lose their
  colour in spirits, and become uniformly dull or light brown in museums. There are a few, however,
  which retain their brilliancy, like <i>Aphrodite</i> and <i>Chloeia</i>, but in both cases the
  coloration is due to the beautiful hair-like bristles ranged along each side of the animal; in the
  former the colours of the rainbow flash from specimens which have been kept in spirit for any
  length of time. The Polynoids, too, with their golden chaetae and pigmented scales, retain to some
  extent their characteristic colouring. But the colours of most Annelids are due to pigments in the
  skin, together with the haemoglobin of the blood, which are soluble, or otherwise changed, in
  alcohol; for instance, the bright greenish-blue tint of the common <i>Phyllodoce</i> of our coasts
  is changed to a rich chocolate brown; but such cases are rare, most worms becoming more or less
  decolorised.</p>

  <p>The varied colouring in the Polychaetes, as in other animals, is due to a variety of causes.
  The red is in many cases due to haemoglobin of the vascular system showing through the transparent
  body; the green of the tentacles of the Sabellids and Chlorhaemids is similarly due to
  chlorocruorin. In other cases the contents of the intestine or the tint of the coelomic fluid may
  affect the colour of the worm. In <i>Capitella</i> the coloured excretory products are regained in
  the skin; in an Eunicid living in a yellow sponge, on which it feeds, the colouring matter is
  extracted and stored in the skin; in the same kind of way green caterpillars may owe their tint to
  feeding on green leaves. But many of the Polychaetes possess distinct <i>pigments</i> in the skin;
  thus in <i>Arenicola</i> the dark pigment <span class="pagenum" id="page292"><span
  class="smaller">{292}</span></span>melanin has been recognised; in <i>Cirratulus</i> and
  <i>Nereis</i> certain lipochromes; whilst <i>Eulalia viridis</i> contains a pigment allied to
  bonellein. These various pigments yield different absorption bands when a solution is examined
  with the spectroscope; others, however, give no bands, but are distinguished by different chemical
  reactions.<a id="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> The colour of the intestine of
  <i>Chaetopterus</i> has been stated to be due to "modified chlorophyll," but it is quite a
  different substance.</p>

  <p>When seen in the living and healthy condition, however, these Polychaete worms vie with the
  very butterflies in their brilliant and beautiful colourings, and though our own worms are not
  lacking in beauty, many tropical and southern forms exceed them in gayness of tint. Bright reds,
  orange, yellows, greens, blues, rich violets, and sombre browns are all displayed.<a id="NtA_351"
  href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The handsome <i>Terebella nebulosa</i> of our own coasts is coloured bright red, sprinkled with
  white spots. <i>Nicomache lumbricalis</i> is pink, with red girdles. Eunicids are frequently red
  or brown, and the red gills along each side, together with a brilliant iridescence, render these
  worms very beautiful. Nereids present a great range of coloration, from light green to sundry
  tints of brown and red in various combinations. Amongst the Serpulids our common <i>S.
  vermicularis</i> is a very showy little worm, with its orange body, its red gills splashed with
  orange, and its orange operculum streaked with red; and a Southern form, <i>Placostegus
  coeruleus</i>, occurring at the Cape of Good Hope, is provided with beautiful lavender-blue gills.
  Our own Sabellids present examples of beautiful markings on the gills, in different colours or in
  different shades of the same colour. Amongst Polynoids, <i>P. leucohyba</i>, from the Antilles,
  has blue elytra; <i>Hemilepidia erythrotaenia</i>, a long worm from the Cape of Good Hope, has the
  anterior end of its body covered with light blue elytra, whilst the uncovered part is orange, with
  a broad magenta-red band along the dorsal surface.</p>

  <p>The Phyllodocids are mostly very brightly coloured. The common <i>P. lamelligera</i> of our
  coast has a bluish-green body, with olive-green parapodia; but <i>Lopadorhynchus
  erythrophyllum</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page293"><span
  class="smaller">{293}</span></span>from Jamaica, has a blue body with red parapodia; whilst
  <i>Notophyllum myriacyclum</i> has a brown body with longitudinal dark-brown stripes and yellow
  parapodia. Both these worms live in coral reefs, where brilliancy of colour is one of the
  characteristic features of the fauna. Other worms are of various shades of green: the dark green
  <i>Arenicola</i> with red gills; the bright green <i>Eulalia viridis</i>; the deep green
  <i>Amphinome smaragdina</i>, from Jamaica; <i>Gnathosyllis diplodonta</i>, with its green and
  yellow body, serve as examples.</p>

  <p>Patterns or "markings" may be exemplified by <i>Lepidasthenia elegans</i> (Fig. 156), and
  <i>Myrianida fasciata</i>, which has a bright red band on each segment (Fig. 149, p. <a
  href="#page280">280</a>). From this brief list of examples it will be seen that beautiful, and
  even brilliant, coloration is not confined to any particular mode of life; many of the most
  typically tubicolous forms, like the Terebellids and Serpulids, are as brilliantly coloured as the
  most typically free-swimming genera, like the Phyllodocids. Carnivorous forms like Amphinomids and
  Syllids present as wide a range of tint as the limivorous forms like <i>Cirratulus</i>,
  <i>Sabella</i>, or Maldanids. Shore-lovers, and deep-sea dwellers, and surface-swimmers, all
  exhibit equally bright or equally sombre tints; it is therefore difficult and rash to dogmatise on
  the "use" of these colourings to these animals, or to point to this worm as being protectively, to
  the other as being warningly, coloured; for we are too ignorant as to the habits of the worms.</p>

  <p><b>Protective and Mimetic Devices.</b>&mdash;From the point of view of "protection" in the
  evolutionist's sense of the word, we can <span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span
  class="smaller">{294}</span></span>say but little. Protective resemblance there is undoubtedly
  amongst the Polynoids, for the scales of these forms resemble more or less closely the stones or
  sand amongst which they live; in the same species there is great variety in coloration. This
  protective habit is carried still further in the case of <i>Psammolyce</i> by the attachment of
  sand grains to little cups on the elytra, so that the back of the animal is concealed. Certain
  commensals, such as <i>Polyno&euml; arenicolae</i>, <i>P. pentactes</i>, are coloured so as to resemble
  their associates. In a few cases it is possible that the gills of Sabelliformia are protectively
  coloured; for in <i>Sabella pavonia</i> they vary from a light yellowish tint to a deep
  violet-brown, and the dark markings on them are therefore more or less distinct. Spread out as the
  gills are in life, they are in many cases difficult to recognise; it is rather their movement as
  they are withdrawn that attracts one's attention to them, as the tubes of these worms frequently
  serve for the attachment of brownish seaweeds, to which the gills bear resemblance. But, as a
  matter of fact, little work has been done in this direction, and speculation on the matter without
  evidence is worthless. Many pelagic forms, being transparent, such as <i>Tomopteris</i> and
  Alciopids, are no doubt protected by their lack of colour; yet these forms present
  brightly-coloured spots,&mdash;the light-producing organs in the parapodia of the former, and the
  large dark eyes of the latter.</p>

  <p>Semper<a id="NtA_352" href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> mentions a case of possible mimicry
  in a species of <i>Myxicola</i> which lives in the clefts of a coral, <i>Cladocora</i>. The
  branchial funnel, when expanded, resembles very closely the expanded coral in size, colour, etc.;
  but he points out that the species occurs in other situations, where its colouring is not
  protective. Probably the "mimicry" is in other instances merely accidental.</p>

  <p>No doubt many Polychaetes may be "warningly coloured," but experimental evidence is incomplete.
  <i>Polycirrus aurantiacus</i> is bright red, with orange tentacles; these worms were rejected by
  certain fish.<a id="NtA_353" href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> The animal has given up living in
  tubes as all its allies do, and it is the tentacles which appear to be distasteful to its enemies,
  for when irritated it coils itself up and wraps <span class="pagenum" id="page295"><span
  class="smaller">{295}</span></span>itself round with its tentacles. Moreover, when the tentacles
  were cut off the fish did not reject the body of the worm. The tentacles are thus coloured in such
  a way that fish recognise them, and associate with the colour some distasteful property.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Phosphorescence.</b>&mdash;Many worms of very different habits have the power of emitting a
  light from some parts of the body, and they are then said to be "phosphorescent."<a id="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> Probably <i>Chaetopterus</i> is most eminently photogenic; the
  base of the great "wings," the "fans," and other parts emit, on stimulation, an azure blue to
  greenish light, so bright that one may read one's watch by it. Several species of <i>Polyno&euml;</i>
  exhibit a similar phenomenon, each elytron, with the exception of the area of attachment, being
  brilliantly illuminated. In these species the phosphorescent elytra are frequently thrown off by
  the animal, so that possibly they deceive enemies. <i>Polycirrus aurantiacus</i> produces a
  beautiful violet phosphorescence; usually its many tentacles alone show the light, but under
  strong stimulation the entire body takes <span class="pagenum" id="page296"><span
  class="smaller">{296}</span></span>part in the display, and no doubt the phosphorescence has, like
  the colour, a "warning" purpose.</p>

  <p>The production of the light in these various forms is apparently due to two different
  processes. In some cases, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Chaetopterus</i>, Syllids, Terebellids, it appears to be
  due to the oxidation of certain cell contents which are discharged more or less freely on
  irritation of the nerves; whilst in Polynoids the phenomenon is due to some purely nervous
  process, for the elytra have no glands, but are provided with ganglia and a nervous network.</p>

  <p>In other worms, however, there are definite light-producing organs. In <i>Tomopteris</i> there
  is on each parapodium, above and below, a brightly-coloured spherical organ, which for a long time
  was regarded as an eye, but from its structure appears to be a "photogen" (Fig. 167, p. <a
  href="#page315">315</a>). The same is very likely the true explanation of the segmental "eyes" of
  <i>Polyophthalmus</i>, for their structure recalls that of the light-organs of deep-sea
  fishes.</p>

  <p>As many of the phosphorescent Polynoids are commensals, while <i>Chaetopterus</i> inhabits
  tubes, and close allies of other phosphorescent worms have no power of emitting light, it is
  impossible to apply the same explanation of its purpose to all cases alike; in some it may be
  "accidental," though in others it may be of definite use in warning enemies or in attracting
  prey.</p>

  <p>The <b>Food of Worms</b>.&mdash;The Nereidiformia are mostly carnivorous, and feed on small
  Crustacea, Mollusca, sponges, and other animals; and Polynoids are even said to eat one another.
  Many worms do not disdain various seaweeds, whilst the Spioniformia and Scoleciformia, which
  burrow in mud and sand, and are without biting organs, swallow the mud and digest what animal or
  vegetable d&eacute;bris it may contain. The Terebellids and Cryptocephala depend on minute organisms
  which may be driven into the mouth by the action of the cilia of the gills or tentacles.</p>

  <p>In the case of deep-sea forms, it is an interesting fact that the intestines are not
  unfrequently crammed with Radiolaria and Foraminifera in a fairly fresh, uninjured condition,
  indicating that these Rhizopods do not merely <i>sink</i> to the bottom, but must actually
  <i>live</i> there.<a id="NtA_355" href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>economic purposes</b> to which Polychaetes are put are few; they are used either as bait
  for fishes or as food for man.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page297"><span class="smaller">{297}</span></span></div>

  <p>One of the commonest baits used for certain fish, as all who have done any sea-fishing off the
  piers of our coasts know, is the common lug-worm (<i>Arenicola marina</i>), whilst <i>Nephthys
  caeca</i> and <i>Nereis fucata</i> are also used in some places; and for whiting <i>Nereis
  cultrifera</i> and <i>N. diversicolor</i>. <i>Marphysa sanguinea</i>, known to the fishermen in
  some parts as "varme," is less frequently used.</p>

  <p>A peculiar worm&mdash;<i>Palolo viridis</i>&mdash;is used as food by the natives of Samoa and
  Fiji. The worm is similar to our Eunicid <i>Lysidice ninetta</i>, and lives in fissures among
  corals on the reefs, at a depth of about two fathoms. At certain days in October and November they
  leave the reefs and swim to the shores of the above islands, probably to spawn; and this occurs on
  two days in each of the above months&mdash;the day on which the moon is in her last quarter, and
  the day before. The natives, who call the worm "Mbalolo," give the name "Mbalolo lailai" (little)
  to October, and "Mbalolo levu" (large) to November, thereby indicating the relative abundance of
  the worms in these two months. The natives eat them either alive or baked, tied up in leaves; and
  they are esteemed so great a delicacy that presents of them are sent by the chiefs who live on
  shore to those living inland. A dark green-blue Phyllodocid, which is called "A'oon," occurs in

  <p><b>Associated Worms.</b>&mdash;A considerable number of worms live in association with other
  animals, either as commensals or as parasites, and it is not in every case possible to decide in
  what relation the two animals stand. <i>Labrorostratus parasiticus</i>, a Eunicid, is parasitic in
  the body-cavity of <i>Odontosyllis ctenostomatus</i> (Fig. 158); such an association between two
  members of the same group of animals is peculiar; but still more exceptional is the occurrence of
  <i>Haematocleptes terebellides</i>, as a parasite in <i>Marphysa sanguinea</i>, for both parasite
  and host are members of the same family, the Eunicidae. Another Eunicid, <i>Oligognathus
  bonelliae</i>, occurs in the body-cavity of the Gephyrean <i>Bonellia</i>.</p>

  <p>The Polynoid <i>Acholoe astericola</i> and the Hesionid <i>Ophiodromus flexuosus</i> occur as
  ectoparasites (or perhaps commensals) in the ambulacral grooves of the starfish <i>Astropecten
  aurantiacus</i>. An Amphinomid is stated to live in the branchial chamber of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page298"><span class="smaller">{298}</span></span>the barnacle, <i>Lepas anatifera</i>.
  <i>Alciopina parasitica</i> lives, during the early stages of its life-history, within
  <i>Cydippe</i>, and it is possible that most of the Alciopids thus make use of Ctenophores as
  their nurseries.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of the Polynoids are ectoparasitic: <i>P. castanea</i> lodges in the
  peri-oral region of <i>Spatangus purpureus</i>, and in the ambulacral grooves of
  <i>Astropecten</i>; <i>P.</i> (<i>Halosydna</i>) <i>bairdi</i> lives between the mantle and foot
  of the mollusc <i>Fissurella cratitia</i>; <i>P. pentactes</i> is found on the body of the
  Holothurian <i>Cucumaria pentactes</i>, and appears to be protectively coloured. <i>P.</i>
  (<i>Antino&euml;</i>) <i>parasitica</i> lives under the elytra of another Polynoid, and <i>P.
  acanellae</i> on the coral <i>Acanella normani</i>.<a id="NtA_357"
  href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As commensals there may be mentioned <i>Nereis fucata</i>, which lives in the upper coil of
  whelk-shells which are inhabited by a hermit crab. The same shell usually bears a particular
  sea-anemone, so that there are three animals living together in or upon the cast-off house of a
  fourth. <i>Siphonostoma</i> is found in the "nests" made by the mollusc <i>Lima</i>. A
  <i>Eunice</i> is constantly associated with the coral <i>Lophohelia prolifera</i>, amongst the
  branches of which the worm twines its tube; whilst another Polychaete inhabits a tube formed by
  the interweaving of the fine branches of the coral <i>Antipathes filix</i>,<a id="NtA_358"
  href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> found in the West Indian seas. A species of <i>Polydora</i>
  forms its tube in <i>Heliopora</i>. The Polynoids present many instances of commensalism, a few of
  which may be here mentioned. <i>P. johnstoni</i> Marenz. is only found in the tubes of
  <i>Terebella nebulosa</i>; other species occur in the tubes of other Terebellids. <i>P.
  marphysae</i> lives in tubes of the Eunicid <i>Marphysa sanguinea</i>. Two species live in the
  tubes of <i>Chaetopterus</i>. <i>P. extenuata</i> has been found in tubes of <i>Serpula
  vermicularis</i>, while <i>P. arenicolae</i> occurs on <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span
  class="smaller">{299}</span></span>the body of the common lug-worm, with the colouring of which it
  closely harmonises.</p>

  <p><b>Worms as Hosts.</b>&mdash;The Polychaeta serve not only as food for fishes, Crustacea, and
  other predatory animals of larger size, but are also liable to be the hosts of parasites<a
  id="NtA_359" href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> such as Gregarines, and even, as we have seen, of
  other members of their own group. Sundry ectoparasitic Copepoda have been found attached to worms
  between the parapodia or to the sides of the feet, and an unnamed Copepod occurs attached,
  sometimes in considerable numbers, to the sides of <i>Nereis cultrifera</i>. The Polychaeta also
  act as protectors to other animals, for on the under surface of elytra of sundry Polynoids may
  very frequently be found specimens of <i>Loxosoma</i>, which may also be attached to gills of
  Eunicids; whilst below those of <i>Aphrodite echidna</i> and <i>Hermadion pellucidum</i>,
  <i>Pedicellina belgica</i> occurs. Under the felt of <i>A. aculeata</i> the Sabellid
  <i>Branchiomma vigilans</i> forms its tube, and Vorticellids may be found on chaetae, gills, or
  other parts of the body of sundry worms.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Very little can be said in a brief way of the <i>geographical
  distribution</i> of these worms, for many of the genera are cosmopolitan, although only a few
  species occur in all the great oceans, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Polyno&euml; imbricata</i>, <i>Hyalinoecia
  tubicola</i>, <i>Nerine</i> (<i>Scolecolepis</i>) <i>cirrata</i>, and <i>Terebellides
  stroemi</i>.</p>

  <p>As for species, it can be said generally that the different oceanic areas and even different
  coasts present different species, but we know practically nothing of variation amongst Polychaeta,
  and many so called species may be mere local varieties, for frequently the descriptions of "new
  species" are scarcely intelligible. At any rate we know that certain species occur at widely
  separated localities, for two or three species of Polynoids occur in Japan, and again at Dinard on
  the French coast. A considerable number of species are common to both sides of the North Atlantic
  ocean, having been obtained off Norway and in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence. A few of these which
  are common on our coasts may be enumerated:&mdash;<i>Nereis pelagica</i>, <i>Nicomache
  lumbricalis</i>, <i>Glycera capitata</i>, <i>Thelepus cincinnatus</i>, <i>Scoloplos armiger</i>,
  <i>Sabella pavonia</i>, <i>Ophelia limacina</i>, <i>Aphrodite aculeata</i>, <i>Trophonia
  plumosa</i>, <i>Polyno&euml; squamata</i>, <i>Capitella capitata</i>, <i>Sthenelais limicola</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span class="smaller">{300}</span></span></div>

  <p>As for <i>bathymetrical</i> distribution,<a id="NtA_360" href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>
  many genera occur at all depths, though Polychaetes appear to be most abundant, as far as we know
  at present, in "shallow water"&mdash;that is, down to twenty fathoms or so; but this may be due to
  the greater facility of collection on shore and in these slight depths, for the "Challenger"
  obtained considerable numbers of new species at greater depths.</p>

  <p>The "deep-sea" forms are chiefly tubicolous, and since these tubes are fixed and partially
  embedded in the bottom, probably comparatively few are brought up. Some genera occur at very great
  depths; thus the Terebellid <i>Leaena abyssorum</i> and the Serpulid <i>Placostegus
  benthalianus</i> were brought up from 3125 fathoms&mdash;the greatest depth from which Polychaetes
  were obtained by H.M.S. "Challenger"; and it is interesting to note that species of each of these
  two genera occur in shallow water, the Serpulid being represented in our own coast fauna by <i>P.
  tricuspidata</i>.</p>

  <p>Amongst our own fauna, a few examples may be given of the "replacement of species."<a
  id="NtA_361" href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> The littoral <i>Sthenelais boa</i> is represented
  by <i>S. limicola</i> in deeper water; <i>Sabellaria alveolata</i> by <i>S. spinulosa</i>;
  <i>Polyno&euml; imbricata</i> by several deep-water species. Similarly with genera: the littoral
  <i>Pomatoceros</i> is replaced by <i>Serpula</i> in deeper water; and the Hesionid <i>Psamathe</i>
  by <i>Castalia</i>.</p>

  <p>The limitation of species to certain regions, or to certain depths of an ocean, may appear at
  first sight peculiar, in view of the unrestricted communication between all its parts; but there
  are as efficient "barriers" there as on land, for generally a particular worm can live only in a
  certain temperature and at a certain pressure, and is dependent for its food on particular
  organisms, which in their turn depend on the depth and its accompaniments. It is, in fact, so much
  the more peculiar that certain species are more or less cosmopolitan, or occur at widely distant
  points. It is less peculiar, of course, to find different species of the same genus at different
  depths or in different areas, for any slight variation in a species advantageous to new conditions
  would readily be fixed, and give rise to a new species.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the Polychaeta depends probably on the pelagic larvae, which are carried by
  currents from one part of an ocean to another. There can be little doubt that many <span
  class="pagenum" id="page301"><span class="smaller">{301}</span></span>Polychaetes are very
  "plastic," and can adapt themselves to changed conditions of life with considerable ease; for
  <i>Nereis diversicolor</i>, <i>Arenicola marina</i>, and others live equally well in water of very
  different densities, and with a different food supply. The great variety in the "habitats," and
  presumably therefore in their food supply, etc., exhibited by many Polychaetes, as well as the
  great variation observable in some species of Polynoina, and the close affinity of the species and
  genera of this sub-family, lead us to the same conclusion.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Polychaetes.</b>&mdash;The most numerous fossil records of the Polychaetes are
  calcareous tubes of various shapes and sizes; they are irregularly or spirally curved, and are
  very usually attached at one end, or by one surface, to stones or to fossils. These tubes belong
  to the Serpulidae, and are referred to the genera <i>Serpula</i>, <i>Spirorbis</i>,
  <i>Ditrupa</i>, and others.<a id="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Spirorbis</i> is the oldest unequivocal representative of the Polychaetes, as its tubes are
  found more or less abundantly in the Silurian and other Palaeozoic strata. In Palaeozoic times
  <i>Serpula</i> was rare, as it was too in the Trias and Lias, but in the Jurassic strata it
  becomes abundant. In the chalk, <i>S. socialis</i> may occur in masses like <i>S. uncinata</i> of
  the present day, forming "Serpulite chalk." In the older tertiaries the genus is represented by
  <i>Spirulaea</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Terebella lapilloides</i> occurs in the Lias as a cylindrical, more or less curved tube of
  sand-grains.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Amongst the Nereidiformia the remains are fewer, but the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>acicula and the hard jaws are preserved in
  certain rocks, and can be referred to existing families. <i>Eunicites avitus</i><a id="NtA_363"
  href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> is represented by a double series of acicula, indicating the
  parapodia of the two sides; and by remains of both upper and lower jaws (Fig. 159). Four different
  species of the worm have been described from the lithographic slate of Bavaria, of Jurassic age;
  and several upper jaws of other Eunicids have been discovered in the Palaeozoic beds of Canada and
  Scotland, and have received the names <i>Lumbriconereites</i>, <i>Oenonites</i>, and
  <i>Arabellites</i>, in reference to their nearest allies amongst living genera.</p>

  <p>There are, however, numerous remains, in the forms of tracks or casts, in the earlier rocks,
  which have been referred to the Polychaeta. The names <i>Crossopodia</i>, <i>Myrianites</i>,
  <i>Nereites</i>, <i>Phyllodocites</i>, have been given to some of these traces, though they are
  open to numerous other interpretations. Some of the "tracks" are similar to those made by living
  Crustacea in walking over wet sand; others appear to be the casts of some animals. Tubular burrows
  in rocks or fossils, some straight, others <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, have received
  such names as <i>Arenicolites</i>, <i>Scolithus</i>, <i>Histioderma</i>; whilst under the name
  <i>Lumbricaria</i> certain cylindrical, coiled structures, resembling worm "castings," are met
  with in this same lithographic stone of Solenhofen. Many of the tubes referred to Polychaetes by
  the earlier palaeontologists have been transferred to other groups; thus <i>Cornulites</i> is now
  believed to be a Pteropod shell.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This very meagre geological record is quite insufficient to form any basis for a
  phylogeny of the group. And this poor supply of remains is not surprising, when we consider the
  soft nature of the tissues, the absence, in the majority of families, of skeleton and of other
  parts which could have been fossilised; yet we might have expected a greater abundance of
  fossilised jaws than is represented at present. But it must be borne in mind that the conditions
  of life of these soft-bodied animals are not conducive to their leaving abundant fossilised
  remains.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">CHARACTERS OF THE SUB-ORDERS OF
  POLYCHAETES&mdash;CHARACTERS OF THE FAMILIES&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF BRITISH GENERA AND
  SPECIES&mdash;THE MYZOSTOMARIA.</span></p>

  <p><b>Systematic.</b>&mdash;The Order Polychaeta may be divided into two branches, in one of
  which, the <span class="sc">Phanerocephala</span>, the prostomium retains its ancestral condition
  as a lobe overhanging the mouth, and frequently carries, in addition to paired eyes, certain
  sensory processes of a simple structure, the tentacles and palps; the body-segments are more or
  less alike, and (except in some Spioniformia, some of the Terebelliformia, and the
  Capitelliformia) do not present two sharply marked regions, owing to the differential arrangement
  or character of the chaetae. In the second branch, the <span class="sc">Cryptocephala</span>, the
  peristomium grows forwards during development, so as to compress or even hide the prostomium,
  which thus becomes a very insignificant organ. The tentacles are reduced, but the palps become
  greatly developed and take on sundry new functions. The body in this group, by the character and
  arrangement of the chaetae, is distinguishable into a thorax and abdomen, presenting certain
  internal differences.</p>

  <p>These two branches may be supposed to have arisen from a common ancestor having a general
  resemblance to a nereidiform worm, such as <i>Syllis</i>, possessing palps and tentacles on the
  prostomium, definite parapodia and cirri on the body, and internally, a well-marked and regular
  repetition of organs.</p>

  <p>The branch <span class="sc">Phanerocephala</span> contains the following five sub-Orders,
  though it is possible that the Capitelliformia deserves a more important position in the
  system<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span>&mdash;The <i>Nereidiformia</i> have well-developed
  tentacles and palps; the peristomium almost invariably possesses <span class="pagenum"
  id="page304"><span class="smaller">{304}</span></span>special cirri; the parapodia are well-marked
  locomotor organs, supported by acicula, and carry dorsal and ventral cirri. The chaetae are
  usually jointed, though unjointed ones may coexist with these; uncini are never present. An
  eversible buccal region leads into a muscular pharynx, which in the majority is armed with
  chitinous jaws; the septa and nephridia are regularly repeated throughout the body. The worms lead
  a predaceous life, and are mostly carnivorous; a few form tubes.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span>&mdash;The <i>Spioniformia</i> possess neither tentacles
  nor palps; the peristomium usually carries a pair of long tentacular cirri, and extends forwards
  at the sides of the prostomium. The parapodia project only to a slight degree; the dorsal cirri
  may attain a considerable size, and act as gills throughout the greater part of the body. The
  chaetae are unjointed; uncini are only present in the aberrant <i>Chaetopterus</i>.<a id="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> The body may present two regions more or less distinctly
  marked externally, but without corresponding internal differences. The buccal region may be
  eversible, but there are no jaws. Septa and nephridia are regularly developed. The worms are
  burrowers, or tubicolous.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 3.</span> <i>Terebelliformia.</i>&mdash;The prostomium is a more or
  less prominent lobe (upper lip) with or without tentacles but without palps. The peristomium may
  carry cirri or "tentacular filaments."<a id="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> The
  parapodia are feebly developed; there are no ventral cirri; the dorsal cirri may exist and
  function as gills on more or fewer of the anterior segments. The chaetae are unjointed, and uncini
  are usually present. The buccal region is not eversible; there are no jaws. The septa are usually
  incomplete, with the exception of one strongly-developed "diaphragm" anteriorly; the nephridia are
  dimorphic, those of the anterior (prediaphragmatic) segments are of large size and are excretory;
  the posterior series are mere funnels, and act as genital ducts. These worms are burrowers or
  tube-formers, and in the majority the tube-forming glands are grouped on the ventral surface of
  the anterior segments to form "gland-shields."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page305"><span class="smaller">{305}</span></span></div>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 4.</span>&mdash;The <i>Capitelliformia</i> have no prostomial
  processes, but possess a pair of large retractile "ciliated organs." The parapodia do not project;
  the chaetae are unjointed, and are hair-like in the anterior segments and hooded "crotchets"
  posteriorly; this external division of the body does not correspond with definite internal
  differences. There are no cirri, though special "gills," often retractile, are frequently present.
  The buccal region is eversible; there is no armed pharynx. An "accessory gut" or "siphon" exists.
  The nephridia are small, and sometimes more than one pair in a segment; special genital funnels
  exist in more or fewer of the anterior segments of the hind body. There is no system of
  blood-vessels; the coelomic corpuscles are red. The worms are burrowers.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 5.</span>&mdash;The <i>Scoleciformia</i> possess a prostomium, which
  rarely (Chlorhaemidae) carries any sensory processes; the peristomium is without cirri (except,
  perhaps, in the Chlorhaemidae). The parapodia are ill developed, and may be absent; only rarely
  are dorsal cirri present, acting as gills; ventral cirri are absent. The chaetae are unjointed;
  true uncini are not present. The buccal region is eversible, but there is no armed pharynx. The
  septa are not regularly developed, as more or fewer are absent, and the nephridia are considerably
  reduced in number, it may be to a single pair (Sternaspidae and some Chlorhaemidae), but they are
  all alike.<a id="NtA_366" href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> The worms are mostly burrowers.</p>

  <p>The branch <span class="sc">Cryptocephala</span> contains two sub-Orders<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> <i>Sabelliformia.</i>&mdash;The prostomium is entirely
  hidden by the forward extension of the peristomium; the tentacles are very small, being frequently
  represented merely by small knobs of sense-cells; the palps, on the other hand, are greatly
  developed, branched, and contain blood-vessels, acting as respiratory as well as sensory organs.
  The peristomium never carries cirri or chaetae, and it is usually raised up into a projecting
  collar, used in fashioning the lip of the animal's tube. The parapodia are but feebly developed;
  cirri are absent, except in the Serpulidae, where the dorsal and ventral cirri become united to
  form the "thoracic membrane" (Meyer). The chaetae are of two kinds&mdash;unjointed, hair-like,
  fringed bristles and "uncini." <span class="pagenum" id="page306"><span
  class="smaller">{306}</span></span>By their arrangement the body is divided into a thorax of nine
  segments and an abdomen; in the former the capillary chaetae are dorsal, and in the latter
  ventral. The buccal region is not eversible; there is no pharynx. The septa are regularly
  developed in the abdomen, but are absent in the thorax; the nephridia are dimorphic; there are two
  large ones in the thorax opening by a median dorsal pore just above the brain; those of the
  abdomen are small funnels, and act as genital ducts. The worms are tubicolous; "gland-shields" are
  present on the thoracic segments.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> <i>Hermelliformia.</i>&mdash;The peristomium
  (Fig. 135) is enormously developed, and forms a bilobed hood capable of closing over the mouth;
  the truncated free end of each lobe carries three semicircles of peculiar chaetae, which act as an
  efficient protection when the worm is withdrawn into its tube. The prostomium is very small, but
  retains a pair of well-developed tentacles; the palps, which are subdivided as in the
  Sabelliformia, have become fused with the ventral edges of the peristomium, and appear as a series
  of ridges on each side, carrying numerous filaments. The thorax consists of five segments, the
  notopodia of three of which are well developed and bear strong chaetae; dorsal cirri are present
  along the greater part of the body, and act as gills. The arrangement of the chaetae and of the
  internal organs is as in the Sabelliformia. The worms form tubes of sand.</p>

  segments.<a id="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> In many genera a dorsal bundle of
  unjointed, natatory chaetae makes its appearance at maturity. The palps, which are grooved, are in
  some cases so united with one another and with the prostomium as to be scarcely recognisable. (For
  head see p. <a href="#page262">262</a>, and for feet see p. <a href="#page264">264</a>.) The
  pharynx is armed with one or more teeth. There is a special gizzard, following the pharynx, and
  provided with thick, muscular walls of peculiar structure. Following the gizzard, the oesophagus
  receives in many genera a pair of <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped diverticula, that are
  used for storing water, which is swallowed with food. These diverticula are absent in
  <i>Autolytus</i> and other free-swimming forms. The reproduction of the members of this family is

  <p><i>Syllis.</i>&mdash;The tentacles and cirri are moniliform; the palps large; there is a single
  dorsal tooth, which is provided with a poison gland, the duct of which opens near its apex; it is
  used rather for stabbing its prey than for grasping and tearing. <i>S. krohnii</i> Ehlers, is
  abundant under stones, and forms tubes of sand; it is nearly an inch long, and consists of some
  eighty-five to ninety-five segments marked with yellow bands. It may readily be identified by
  longer dorsal cirri, terminally dilated, alternating with shorter ones. <i>S. cornuta</i> Rathke,
  has a translucent green body, about half an inch long; no alternation <span class="pagenum"
  id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span>of cirri. Mediterranean, Atlantic, on the
  Norwegian coast, off Spitzbergen, and on the Madeira coast. <i>S. armillaris</i> M&uuml;ll. is very
  common at low water; it is pale yellowish-brown, with a couple of dusky marks on each segment; and
  measures 2 inches. The dorsal cirri are quite short, consisting of only eight to ten joints. In
  <i>Pionosyllis</i> the tentacles and cirri are not moniliform; a single dorsal tooth. <i>P.
  malmgreni</i> M&lsquo;I. under stones. <i>Sphaerosyllis</i>.&mdash;The dorsal cirri are swollen at
  the base, and are not moniliform; the long palps are fused along nearly their whole extent. <i>S.
  hystrix</i> Clap. is only about one-eighth of an inch in length. <i>Exogone</i> Oerst.
  <i>Grubea</i> Qfg.</p>

  <p><i>Autolytus.</i>&mdash;The small palps are entirely fused with the prostomium; the pharynx,
  which is bent upon itself, is armed with a circle of denticles. Dorsal cirri somewhat foliaceous.
  There are no ventral cirri. The male and female differ from one another and from the asexual
  "stock" (see p. <a href="#page279">279</a>). <i>A. pictus</i> Ehl. is abundant under stones. It
  measures about two-thirds of an inch in length, is darkly coloured with a median lighter band; the
  anterior dorsal cirri are long. <i>A. prolifer</i> M&uuml;ll. is common.</p>

  <p><i>Myrianida fasciata</i> Milne Edwards, with its foliaceous cirri, occurs off our coasts (see
  Fig. 149, p. <a href="#page280">280</a>). Atlantic, Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Hesionidae.</i>&mdash;The body is relatively short, with
  only a few segments (sixteen to fifty, according to the genus); in the larger forms it is
  cylindrical. The parapodium is usually uniramous; the dorsal cirri are long and multiarticulate;
  the chaetae are jointed. The prostomium carries, in addition to four eyes, two or three tentacles,

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Aphroditidae.</i><a id="NtA_369"
  href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a>&mdash;The most characteristic feature of this family, and one
  by which its members are absolutely distinguished from all other Chaetopods, is the possession of
  scales or "elytra" on the back. These flattened dorsal cirri are of a somewhat horny texture, and
  are carried, generally, on alternate segments of the body; filamentous cirri occurring on the
  other segments. In the sub-families <i>Hermionina</i> and <i>Polynoina</i> the elytriferous
  segments are 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, etc., up to 23; then every third segment. The worms are usually short,
  with some thirty-five to forty-five segments, though <i>Sthenelais</i> and a few others have many
  more. (For head see p. <a href="#page262">262</a>, and for parapodium see pp. <a
  href="#page265">265</a>, <a href="#page268">268</a>.) The pharynx is very thick walled, and
  furnished with two pairs of jaws, which are, however, not hardened in the sub-family
  <i>Hermionina</i>. The intestine is provided with a number of paired longer or shorter caeca (Fig.
  142). A considerable number of this family are commensal or parasitic (see p. <a
  href="#page297">297</a>). The family is well represented on our own coasts, so that only a few of
  the more readily distinguishable species can be here described.</p>

  ventral cirri of the next segment are also elongated. Jaws are present. Elytra, usually twelve to
  eighteen pairs, the surface of which is more or less papillose, and may be "fringed" along the
  outer border, with long processes. The colouring of the elytra is characteristic in most cases,
  though liable to considerable variation in some species. The chaetae are generally strong, and of
  bright golden colour: they are all unjointed. The <i>Polynoina</i> are generally but feeble
  swimmers, <span class="pagenum" id="page310"><span class="smaller">{310}</span></span>and are
  mostly found under stones at low tide. Some species have a very wide geographical range.</p>

  elytra are very firmly fixed to the body. The notopodial chaetae scarcely project from below the

  outer half pale or white, while its inner half is darker, usually some tint of brown or olive
  green, so that the worm appears to have a dark band along the middle of its back. Other patterns
  occur. The body is entirely covered by the elytra. The chaetae project considerably, and are
  nearly as long as half the width of the body; those of the notopodium are brown and are directed
  upwards, being nearly as long as the golden neuropodial chaetae. This species has a very wide
  range, occurring on both sides of the Atlantic, even on the shores of Nova Zembla, and reappearing
  again at Japan. <i>P. semisculptus</i> Leach is rather larger than the foregoing. The elytra are
  very readily detached: they are light in colour, without a fringe, but with large papillae near

  cirri are not especially modified (see Fig. 132, p. <a href="#page260">260</a>). The body, which
  measures 3 to 6 inches, consists of thirty-five to forty segments, and is broadest in the middle,
  the last dozen segments being very small; the body terminates in a point. Some of the notopodial

  the arrangement of the "paragnaths" (see Fig. 125, <i>d</i>) and so forth. The general features of
  the family have been already described. The genus <i>Nereis</i> is represented by six fairly
  common species on our coast, which are almost world-wide in distribution.</p>

  <p><i>N. diversicolor</i> M&uuml;ll. is about 3 to 4 inches in length, of a general fleshy-red colour,
  though tending in some cases to yellowish-brown or even greenish. It may be distinguished by two
  diverging brown bands, which start on the peristomium and pass backward one along each side of the
  body for several segments. The prostomium is broader than it is long. The worm burrows in mud or
  sand, all round our coast between tide-marks. It has a very wide distribution, being met with on
  this side of the Atlantic, and off the coast of Greenland, and off Japan. It is even found in
  brackish water at Bembridge, Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p><i>N. cultrifera</i> Gr. is green or greenish-grey, with a series of small rectangular light
  spots along the mid-dorsal surface, and oblique light lines at the sides of each segment.
  Posteriorly the greenish pigment becomes less and less till the hinder segments are
  flesh-coloured. The prostomium is as long as it is broad. This species attains a length of 6
  inches. Southern coasts: locally known as "Red Cat."</p>

  <p><i>N. dumerilii</i> Aud. and Edw. is rather smaller and narrower than the two preceding
  species; it is reddish-violet in colour, marked with darker transverse lines in each segment. It
  is readily recognised by the two dark brown spots on the upper surface of the base of the
  notopodium in most of the segments, and by the great length of the peristomial cirri, the longest
  of which reaches the fifteenth segment. It is sometimes found enclosed in a cocoon-like tube of
  hardened grey mucus, more or less covered with foreign particles, such as sand grains. Atlantic,
  Mediterranean, Japan.</p>

  <p><i>N. pelagica</i> L. is red-brown or bronze in colour, and is generally larger than the other
  species, from which it is distinguished by being widest about the middle of the body (see Fig.

  segments immediately following the head. Further, the palps are long, the peristomium is twice as
  long as the next segment, and the back of the worm is strongly arched. At all depths on rocky and
  stony ground. Northern coasts.</p>

  <p><i>N.</i> (<i>Nereilepas</i>) <i>fucata</i> Sav. lives in the topmost whorls of empty whelk
  shells and in those occupied by hermit crabs. The ground colour is tile-red, with two milk-white
  bands along the dorsal surface. The dorsal lobe of the foot is slightly foliaceous, glandular, and
  vascular.</p>

  <p><i>N.</i> (<i>Alitta</i>) <i>virens</i> Sars. is a giant amongst Polychaetes, reaching a length
  of 18 inches. Its name suggests its colour; it is very plentiful at certain times at St. Andrews,
  and between tide-marks along the shore of the Mersey estuary, as well as elsewhere. It forms a
  burrow in the clay, etc., of the shore, and lines it with mucus, which is abundantly secreted by
  the great foliaceous lobes of the parapodia. These great leaf-like lobes of the foot recall the
  modification which the foot of many species of <i>Nereis</i> undergoes in transformation into
  <i>Heteronereis</i>: they are so greatly developed that, at first sight, the worm might be
  mistaken for a large <i>Phyllodoce</i>. The worm is known as the "Creeper," and is much esteemed

  and are absent ventrally (Fig. 137, C, p. <a href="#page265">265</a>). The dorsal and ventral
  cirri are more or less filiform, and there is an intermediate similar process on the back (? = lip

  called "gills."<a id="NtA_380" href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> The presence of these and of
  the chaetae give the upper surface of the body a fluffy appearance. <i>E. foliosa</i> Aud. and
  Edw. is fairly common under stones on our southern shores. It is about an inch in length and is of
  a cinnamon-red colour.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 9.</span> <i>Eunicidae.</i>&mdash;The elongated body is provided with
  parapodial gills in more or fewer segments (except in <i>Lumbriconereis</i>). The "gills" may be
  cirriform (<i>Hyalinoecia</i>), pectinate (<i>Eunice</i>, <i>Onuphis</i>), or more complex
  (<i>Diopatra</i>). The notopodium is represented by a lobe (usually called "cirrus") into which an
  aciculum projects; in some cases it even contains a few chaetae; most of the neuropodial chaetae
  are jointed (Fig. 138, F). The prostomial tentacles vary in number; they may be three or five, or
  five and two short "frontal palps," or they may be absent. Peristomial cirri are absent, though in
  <i>Eunice</i>, <i>Diopatra</i>, and <i>Onuphis</i> "nuchal cirri" are present on the dorsal
  surface of the second segment (Fig. 134, D). One of the most characteristic features in the
  anatomy of the Eunicids is the peculiar jaw apparatus (see p. <a href="#page270">270</a>). The
  majority of the genera form permanent tubes of parchment-like consistency, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page319"><span class="smaller">{319}</span></span>which may be further strengthened by the
  addition of grains of sand, small pebbles, etc.; the tubes may be branched.</p>

  <p><i>Eunice</i> has five tentacles, two great palps, and a pair of nuchal cirri; the gills are
  pectinate, and there are four anal cirri. <i>E. harassii</i> Aud. and Edw. is about 8 inches long.
  It is reddish-brown, with white spots down the back, one to each segment, and others at the sides.
  The gills begin at the sixth segment, and when fully developed have eleven branches. The dorsal
  cirrus is not longer than the gill. <i>E. philocorallia</i> Buch.<a id="NtA_381"

  "Rockworm" in the Channel Islands.</p>

  <p><i>Hyalinoecia</i> Mgrn., in addition to the five prostomial tentacles and palps, possesses a

  <p><i>Scoloplos armiger</i> M&uuml;ll. is extremely common on our coast. It is about an inch long,
  yellowish, with red gills, commencing about the twelfth segment. Each of the lobes of the

  termed "tentacles") normally directed backwards, very mobile, and more or less coiled. They are
  readily thrown off by the animal. The notopodial cirri are long, finger-shaped, and curved over
  the back; they are vascular and ciliated, and function as "gills." The neuropodia project
  laterally. Both are usually provided with a "podal membrane" along their outer margin. There are
  no ventral cirri; the dorsal chaetae are fringed capillaries; the ventral are "crotchets." The
  buccal region is eversible. The worms burrow in mud and sand.</p>

  <p><i>Spio seticornis</i> Fabr. is a small worm less than an inch in length, colourless except for
  the red blood in its vessels. It builds long and flexible tubes of sand in the clefts of rocks and
  under stones in the upper part of the littoral zone. The prostomium is notched at the anterior
  margin. The gills commence on the twelfth segment, and do not extend to the end of the body. A
  membrane-like cirrus exists also on the second chaetigerous segment. The podal membrane is adnate

  <p><i>Nerine</i> is represented by two species, sometimes called "Ragworms." The genus is very
  similar to <i>Spio</i>, but the worms are of larger size. The prostomium is compressed by the
  forward growth of the peristomium, and appears as a ridge on the latter segment, extending
  downwards in front towards the mouth. The "gills" commence on the second segment, and are
  continued in every segment except the hindmost. <i>Nerine</i> (<i>Scolecolepis</i>)
  <i>vulgaris</i> Jnstn. is readily distinguished from other species by its somewhat <span
  class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped prostomium. It is an extremely common worm under stones and
  amongst seaweed at low water. It is some 3 or 4 inches in length and more slender than the
  following species. Its colour is yellowish-brown, and the red gills directed upwards and backwards
  give the appearance of oblique red lines. The podal membrane does not reach the tip of the gill.

  coniocephala</i> Jnstn. is much the same colour, but reaches a length of 8 inches, and a diameter
  of &frac14; inch. The prostomium is conical. The podal membrane reaches to the tip of the gill in the
  anterior segments. The worm burrows rather more deeply and nearer low-water mark than the
  preceding species.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Polydoridae.</i>&mdash;<i>Polydora</i> Bosc (=
  <i>Leucodore</i> Jnstn.) is readily distinguished from the other Spionids, and, indeed, from any
  other Polychaet (except <i>Chaetopterus</i>), by possessing specially strong chaetae in the
  enlarged fifth chaetigerous segment. The anterior segments differ from the rest in the absence of
  gills and in the character of the chaetae (Fig. 133, A, p. <a href="#page261">261</a>).</p>

  <p><i>P. ciliata</i> Jnstn. inhabits soft mud tubes near low water; it also makes <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped galleries in stones and shells, and the tube projects from each
  mouth. The worm is about &frac12; inch long, consists of some forty segments, and is yellowish or
  flesh-coloured. The prostomium resembles that of <i>Spio</i>; the peristomium is raised into a
  slight collar at each side. The anus is surrounded by an incomplete funnel. The species has almost
  a world-wide distribution, having been recorded from Iceland, Australia, the Philippine Islands,
  as well as from the European seas. <i>P. coeca</i> Oerst. often lives commensally with a sponge,
  having a protective odour.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Chaetopteridae.</i>&mdash;The family is represented on our
  coasts by <i>Chaetopterus variopedatus</i> Ren.,<a id="NtA_383"
  href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> which is found at the Channel Islands, the Scilly Isles, the
  Isle of Man, and the west Scottish coast, and probably at various other places, at low water and
  down to a depth of some 15 fathoms. It occurs in all European seas. The animal builds a long tube,
  the basis of which is a tough, parchment-like substance; this is coated externally with sand,
  small pebbles, and other d&eacute;bris: it is of considerable length and about &frac34; inch in diameter, is
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped and open at both ends, the greater part of it being
  embedded in sand or in crevices of rocks. The animal, whose body-wall is thin and delicate, never
  leaves its tube. The body has a bizarre appearance; three regions are readily <span
  class="pagenum" id="page324"><span class="smaller">{324}</span></span>distinguishable, which may
  be denoted by the letters A, B, and C. The most anterior region, A, is flattened, and carries nine
  pairs of conical lobes with delicate chaetae, though the fourth lobe possesses special stouter
  chaetae (as in <i>Polydora</i>). The anterior end of the body terminates in a wide funnel, the
  boundary of which is formed chiefly by the peristomium; on its dorsal surface is a pair of
  tentacle-like processes (peristomial cirri); the region between which represents the
  prostomium.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The second region, B, is very curiously modified; it is formed of five segments. The most
  anterior is produced on either side into a great wing-like process, which in life is directed
  forwards above the region A. Each is grooved on its inner side, the ciliated grooves being
  continuous with a median groove running forwards along the back of A; this apparatus serves to
  bring food to the great funnel-like mouth. The next segment (twelfth) carries a dorsal and ventral
  "sucker," representing the parapodia. Each of the segments 13, 14, 15 carries a membranous fold
  encircling the body. By the constant movement of these "fans," which have nearly the same diameter
  as the tube, a current of water is constantly washed over the animal. The fans represent the
  notopodia; the neuropodia are bilobed rounded knobs. The region C consists in the adult of about
  thirty segments, all alike, and less modified than the preceding. The animal is the most truly
  tubicolous of the Polychaetes, and is much modified on this account. No locomotor chaetae are
  present, though the great wings and notopodial processes of region C contains chitinous bristles,
  which, however, do not project;<a id="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> the anterior
  region with its stiff chaetae, and the neuropodial uncinal plates of the rest of the body serve in
  its movements up and down the tube, while the "suckers" fix the worm temporarily to the wall of
  its house.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Chaetopterus</i> is highly phosphorescent (see p. <a href="#page295">295</a>). It is further
  interesting on account of the green colouring-matter, which is extracted by alcohol. Two commensal
  Polynoids occur in the tube, viz. <i>Polyno&euml; glabra</i> and <i>P. cirrosa</i>. The larva is
  "mesotrochal" (with a ciliated ring round its middle), that region of the body lying in front of
  the cilia giving rise to the region A, whilst the rest of the body gives rise to regions B and
  C.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 4.</span> <i>Magelonidae.</i>&mdash;This family includes only the very
  peculiar worm, <i>Magelona papillicornis</i> Fr. M&uuml;ll., which lives buried in sand, between
  tide-marks, in various parts of our coast and that of the United States. Its chief features are
  the large, flat, spoon-shaped prostomium; the long peristomial cirri, slightly expanded
  terminally, carrying papillae along one side; the enormous, eversible buccal region, which is an
  important respiratory organ. The blood is of a madder-pink colour, and the blood-vessels in the
  thorax are greatly dilated. The body of the worm is divisible into two well-marked regions, owing
  to differences in the chaetae.<a id="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

  only one species, <i>Owenia filiformis</i> D. Ch. Some of the anterior segments are longer than
  the hinder ones, though the arrangement of chaetae is alike throughout. The mouth is wide, like
  that of <i>Chaetopterus</i>, and is surrounded, except ventrally, by a membrane, so deeply notched
  as to give rise to flattened filaments containing blood-vessels. These "gills" appear to belong to
  the peristomium. The small worm in its sandy tube is plentiful on our coasts in about 20 fathoms.

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 3. Terebelliformia.</b></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 1.</span> <i>Cirratulidae.</i>&mdash;These worms have a cylindrical body,
  more or less attenuated at each end; the segments are distinct, and similar throughout, with
  capillary chaetae on each side in two bundles, carried by small papillae. The prostomium is
  conical, the peristomium usually without cirri. On more or fewer segments the dorsal cirri are
  long and filamentous, and function as gills. There is a single pair of anterior nephridia: the
  septa and genital ducts are repeated throughout the hinder part of the body. The worms usually
  live in burrows.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page326"><span class="smaller">{326}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Cirratulus.</i>&mdash;The prostomium is long, sometimes annulated. In addition to the
  segmental filamentous "gills" there is a transverse row of long "tentacular filaments" across one
  of the anterior segments, and it has been suggested that they are really prostomial tentacles
  which have shifted backwards. They and the gills twist about in a very active fashion during life,
  and look like small independent worms, especially when they are detached. <i>C. cirratus</i> M&uuml;ll,
  is a brown or dirty yellowish worm about 4 to 6 inches in length, usually to be found under
  stones, partially embedded in the mud or sand. The prostomium carries a pair of linear groups of
  "eye-spots"; the first chaetigerous segment carries a transverse row of tentacular filaments, and
  the red gill-filaments commence on the same segment. Common. <i>C. tentaculatus</i> Mont. is a
  larger worm, dark red in colour, and is distinguished from the preceding by the absence of eyes

  it also moves freely in the mud. Its chief features are (1) a pair of long, ciliated <span
  class="pagenum" id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span>"cephalic tentacles,"
  probably peristomial, and similar to the "tentacular filaments" of <i>Dodecaceria</i>; (2) a pair
  of filamentous gills (dorsal cirri) on the first chaetigerous segment; (3) a pair of large green
  nephridia in the anterior segments.  The describer placed it amongst the Spionids, but the above
  and other features point to Cirratulid affinities.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Terebellidae.</i>&mdash;The body is cylindrical, and
  generally larger in front than behind. The prostomium is generally flattened, and forms a mobile
  upper lip, which always carries a transverse series of many tentacles; it may bear "eye-spots,"
  but never palps; the lower lip is formed by the peristomium. There are one to three pairs of
  gills, which are usually more or less branched, on as many segments.<a id="NtA_387"
  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The chaetigerous lobes are small; the dorsal ones contain capillary chaetae, which are
  frequently confined to the anterior segments, whilst the ventral chaetae are uncini. The ventral
  surface of the anterior segments is thickened by glands which secrete the mucus employed in
  tube-building; the number of these "shields" and of the dorsal bundles of chaetae have to be noted
  in identifying the worms. There are one to three pairs of large anterior nephridia. A very strong
  "diaphragm"&mdash;usually more or less pouched&mdash;cuts off this anterior region of the
  body-cavity from the rest, and is the only complete septum in the body; from three to twelve pairs
  of small generative ducts occur behind it. The family is tubicolous, foreign materials being

  <p><i>Amphitrite johnstoni</i> Mgrn. (Fig. 175) is brown in colour, about 4 to 6 inches in length,
  and nearly &frac12; inch in breadth anteriorly. Each of the gills consists of a curved stem; from the
  convex side of which arise a number of branches, themselves dichotomously divided, the final
  branches being long (Fig. 176, A). There are twelve ventral "gland shields." The worm is fairly
  common between tide-marks, below stones in muddy places: the end of its tube of mud projects above
  the surface. Atlantic.</p>

  <p><i>Terebella</i> (<i>Polymnia</i>) <i>nebulosa</i> Mont. is distinguished by its bright red
  colour, spotted with white; it is 6 or 7 inches in length, and &frac12; inch across. Large specimens of
  this beautiful worm may be obtained at Weymouth and elsewhere on the south coast, where it lives
  in about 14 fathoms. Each gill appears much more arborescent than in the preceding (Fig. 176, B);
  it consists of a main stem, from which comparatively few branches arise; these subdivide
  frequently, and the terminal branchlets are quite short. The "gland shields" are fourteen to
  sixteen in number. The tube is of mud. North Sea and Mediterranean. <i>T.</i> (<i>Leprea</i>)
  <i>lapidaria</i> L. is 1 inch in length, orange-red in colour; and has 12 ventral shields. The
  tube, of fine mud, lies horizontally on the under surface of stones.</p>

  <p><i>T.</i> (<i>Lanice</i>) <i>conchilega</i> Pall. (the "sand mason") forms a very
  characteristic tube of sandy particles, small pebbles, and pieces of shell. It is buried in the
  sand, but a short portion protrudes, and bears, set round its edge, a fringe of branching sandy
  threads (Fig. 153) commonly seen on sandy shores between tide-marks. The worm may be distinguished
  from the preceding species by the fact that the series of fourteen to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page329"><span class="smaller">{329}</span></span>seventeen gland shields are red, and
  continuous from segment to segment. The gill is shown in Fig. 176, C. North Sea, Atlantic, and

  <p><i>Nicolea venustula</i> Mont. has only two pairs of equal, arborescent gills (Fig. 176, D);
  the tentacles are comparatively few. The animal, which is about an inch in length, is
  cinnamon-yellow with white spots, and has seventeen gland shields. 20 fathoms, North Sea and
  Mediterranean. <i>Pista cristata</i> M&uuml;ll. is readily recognised by the shape of the gills (Fig.
  176, E), of which there are only two pairs. Each consists of a long peduncle, bearing a number of
  dichotomously dividing, rather spirally-arranged branches, the whole having the appearance of a
  "bottle-brush." The worm is 2 to 4 inches long, of greyish-red to yellow colour. Atlantic east and
  west (even at the mouth of the Congo), and Mediterranean. <i>Thelepus cincinnatus</i> Fabr. is
  about the same length, pale red in colour, marked on its back with clear areas, giving the
  appearance of lacework. The gills are represented by numerous unbranched filaments arising
  separately in two transverse rows. The tube, which is adherent to shells, etc., along its whole
  length, is of thin, transparent, and flexible material like mica, covered with foreign bodies, and
  even with Polyzoa and Hydrozoa. 30 fathoms, Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span class="smaller">{330}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Polycirrus aurantiacus</i> Gr. is sometimes placed in a special sub-family, as it has no
  gills. The numerous tentacles are very long, and arise from a great hood over the mouth; the
  capillary chaetae commence in the first segment and extend for about half the length of the body;
  the uncini commence in the ninth segment. The ventral "shields" are paired. The animal is highly
  coloured; its phosphorescence and its distastefulness have already been mentioned on p. <a
  href="#page294">294</a>. In <i>Terebellides stroemi</i> Sars, four comb-like gills arise from a
  single common thick peduncle on the back of the second segment (Fig. 176, F). The ventral surface
  of the body bends upwards anteriorly so as to bring the mouth to the dorsal surface. 13 to 16
  fathoms, muddy bottoms, North Sea and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Ampharetidae.</i>&mdash;This family differs from the
  Terebellids chiefly in the shape of the head and in the presence of a bundle of strong chaetae (or
  paleae) on each side of the head in front of the gills, of which there are four on each side. Each
  gill is a simple filiform process, considerably longer than the tentacles, which are very few in
  number. <i>Amphicteis gunneri</i> Sars, <i>Ampharete gracilis</i> Mgrn., and <i>Melinna
  cristata</i> Sars, occur on our coasts.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Fam. 4.</span> <i>Amphictenidae.</i>&mdash;This contains the
  interesting genus <i>Pectinaria</i>, in which the head is protected by great golden chaetae on the
  second segment; they are flattened, curved, and pointed, and are arranged in a single transverse
  row on each side, serving as an operculum to the tube. The posterior end of the worm has undergone
  great degeneration, and is represented by a small leaf-like "scapha" which serves to close the
  tube posteriorly. The worm is 1&frac12; inches in length and consists of only twenty segments, of which
  seventeen are chaetigerous. The tube is nearly cylindrical, but wider anteriorly than posteriorly
  (Fig. 152, p. <a href="#page288">288</a>); the sand grains are uniform in size, and are embedded
  in the secreted mucus in a very regular way, the surface being smooth both <span class="pagenum"
  id="page331"><span class="smaller">{331}</span></span>inside and out. These tubes can be carried
  about by the worm, but may be found projecting from the sand at very low tides. <i>P. belgica</i>
  Pall. forms a straight tube, whilst in <i>P. auricoma</i> M&uuml;ll. the tube is larger and slightly
  curved. The former species appears to be confined to the North Sea; the latter occurs in deeper
  water, and is also present in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam.</span> <i>Capitellidae.</i><a id="NtA_389"
  href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Capitella capitata</i> v.&nbsp;Ben. occurs pretty
  frequently in the sand under stones near low tide-mark. It is a red worm, about 1&frac12; to 2 inches
  long, greatly resembling a Tubificid Oligochaete. It may readily be distinguished from other
  Polychaeta by the strong genital chaetae in the male, which replace the notopodial chaetae of
  segments 8 and 9; those in the former segment are pointed backwards, and in the latter forwards.
  There is but a single pair of generative ducts in either sex in the eighth segment. North Sea,

  British waters by four species, occurring in shallow water.</p>

  <p><i>Ammotrypane aulogaster</i> Rathke, is about 2 inches long; the nearly cylindrical body has a
  ridge running along each side below the chaetae. The conical prostomium is tipped with a small
  knob, and carries at each side a ciliated pit (Fig. 144, p. <a href="#page273">273</a>). Every
  segment, except the first chaetigerous, is provided with a filamentous gill (dorsal cirrus). The
  segmentation <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span class="smaller">{332}</span></span>is very
  obscurely marked, for internally there are only three complete septa, placed far forwards. The
  intestine is bent upon itself. In <i>Ophelia limacina</i> Rthk. the gills commence in the eighth
  segment, and the longitudinal ridge does not extend in front of this segment. The worm is about 1&frac12;
  inches long, and occurs between tide-marks. <i>Travisia forbesi</i> Jnstn., North Sea.
  <i>Polyophthalmus pictus</i><a id="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> Duj. is very
  abundant at some parts of the coast. There are two bundles of chaetae on each side of every
  segment; each bundle contains three chaetae, of which only one projects to any distance. Paired
  eye-like spots exist on the sides of twelve segments. The worm is about an inch in length.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Maldanidae</i> (= <i>Clymenidae</i>).&mdash;Represented on
  our coasts by four fairly common species. They form sandy tubes, which are embedded in the sand
  with a short portion projecting. In some places they are so abundant that at low water the sand
  has quite a rough appearance. The prostomium is frequently truncated and depressed, and is always
  fused with the peristomium. A horny plate may be developed on the upper surface of the head, and
  the skin at the side of the prostomium is frequently raised into a more or less prominent fold.
  The hinder end of the body carries a funnel surrounding the anus. There are no gills or sensory
  processes on the body. Some of the segments towards the middle of the body may be longer than the
  rest. Peculiar serrated hooks of characteristic shape constitute the neuropodial "torus." The
  buccal region is eversible.</p>

  <p><i>Nicomache lumbricalis</i> Fabr. is a rosy-pink worm with white spots anteriorly; the
  chaetigerous ridges are red. The worm consists of twenty-six segments, and measures 2 or 3 inches.
  It is very narrow and readily breaks in pieces. The prostomium is laterally compressed; the anal
  funnel is fringed with a number of short equal processes. Under stones in the Laminarian zone.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Arenicolidae.</i>&mdash;Here belongs the common "lug-worm"
  <i>Arenicola marina</i> L., which occurs all round our coasts between tide-marks, and is so
  generally used as bait in fishing. The worm, which measures 5 to 8 inches, is of a dark tint,
  usually brownish-green. It burrows to a depth of some 18 inches or 2 feet, and throws up a
  considerable quantity of "castings" or "sand-ropes," which are noticeable on every shore
  consisting of mud or muddy sand. The body of the worm is cylindrical, thicker anteriorly; the
  segments are indistinct, owing to the secondary groovings and furrows on the skin. The prostomium
  is in the adult fused with the peristomium; this and the second segment are achaetous. Then follow
  twenty chaetigerous segments with dorsal bundles of capillary chaetae and ventral rows of short
  crotchets. The hinder region of the body is achaetous and narrower than the rest, forming a
  "tail." There are twelve (sometimes thirteen) pairs of arborescent red gills on segments 9 to 20
  (21). Internally there are <span class="pagenum" id="page334"><span
  class="smaller">{334}</span></span>only four complete septa, and six pairs of nephridia, which are
  of large size: the fore-gut is eversible. Atlantic and Mediterranean. A second and smaller
  species, <i>A. ecaudata</i> Jnstn., occurs on our southern coasts; it is readily distinguished by
  the absence of a "tail," the chaetae and gills being continued to the end of the body.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 4.</span> <i>Scalibregmidae.</i>&mdash;Prostomium ill-marked, fringed
  with small processes. Parapodia represented by slight papillae; two bundles of chaetae; usually

  Oerst. has gills on first six segments. North Sea. <i>Scalibregma inflata</i> Rthke. has
  arborescent gills on segments 4 to 7. The anterior part of the body is dilated. North Sea.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 5.</span> <i>Chlorhaemidae.</i>&mdash;The family derives its name from
  the green colour of the blood, due to chlorocruorin. The representatives are comparatively short
  worms, with capillary chaetae on all the segments, the limits of which are not evident. The
  prostomium carries a pair of long grooved yellowish processes, which are perhaps palps, and
  several green tentacles, acting as "gills," arranged in a transverse series above the mouth (Fig.
  134, F, p. <a href="#page262">262</a>). The peristomium is achaetous; the whole "head" can be
  withdrawn into the body. The chaetae of the anterior segments are especially long, and directed
  forwards so as to form a "cage" for the head. The body-wall is covered with longer or shorter
  papillae. Internally, the chief points of interest are the presence of only two septa
  (<i>Trophonia</i>) or only one septum (<i>Siphonostoma</i>), situated somewhere in front of the
  middle of the body, and forming a great backwardly-directed pouch, which contains a part of the
  looped intestine, and the nephridia, of which there are only two or four.</p>

  <p><i>Trophonia plumosa</i> M&uuml;ll. is about 2 to 4 inches long, yellowish-brown in colour, with a
  rough skin; the head is usually retracted. It lives in the mud amongst Laminarian roots down to 50
  fathoms. North Atlantic. <i>Siphonostoma</i> (<i>Flabelligera</i>) <i>diplochaitos</i> Otto, has a
  transparent body-wall, so that the coloured viscera are visible. The skin carries long papillae,
  which traverse a thick jelly-like envelope secreted by it, in <span class="pagenum"

  <i>Sternaspis</i>, has not been recorded on our coasts, but is of so peculiar a structure as to
  deserve a description.<a id="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> <i>S. scutata</i>
  Ranzani, occurring in the Mediterranean, is rather less than an inch in length, and derives its
  name from the possession of a pair of peculiar "horny" plates or shields on the ventral surface
  posteriorly. Around their margins are set about thirty bundles of long capillary chaetae. There
  are three half rings of stronger chaetae on each side near the anterior end of the body. The mouth
  is overhung by a very <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span
  class="smaller">{336}</span></span>small rounded knob (prostomium), which in <i>S. spinosa</i>
  Sluiter, is prolonged outwards on each side to form a grooved palp-like organ, recalling that of
  <i>Bonellia</i>. The anus is placed posteriorly; and in front of it, on the dorsal surface, are
  two bundles of many long thread-like gills. On the ventro-lateral surface, in front of the middle
  of the body, is a pair of finger-shaped processes containing the genital ducts. The anterior
  segments of the body can be withdrawn into the body, as in the <i>Chlorhaemidae</i>. Further
  examination leads to the conclusion that the body of <i>Sternaspis</i> consists of about thirty
  segments, most of them provided with paired bundles of capillary (neuropodial?) chaetae,
  distributed as follows:&mdash;Each of the segments 2, 3, 4 has a half ring of strong chaetae on
  each side; segments 5 to 7 are without chaetae; segments 8 to 14 have chaetae embedded in the
  body-wall, but not projecting. The shields cover the remaining segments; and along the outer edge
  of each are some ten bundles of chaetae, and along the hinder edge some five or six bundles,
  representing as many segments. Thus the worm consists of about thirty segments whose outlines are
  nearly obliterated (as in the <i>Chlorhaemidae</i>), and whose chaetae, except those which are
  specially developed, are disappearing: while posteriorly a great shortening of the body brings the
  bundles close together. A continuation of this process, involving a further disappearance of
  chaetae, leads readily to the condition met with in <i>Echiurus</i>, one of the chaetigerous
  Gephyrea. Internally, further evidence of the relation between <i>Sternaspis</i> and the
  Chlorhaemids with the Gephyrea is afforded by the absence of septa, by the coiled alimentary
  canal, and by the presence of a single pair of nephridia, which in the latter group act both as
  excretory organs and as genital ducts.</p>

  bends to one side on reaching the thorax, and may extend forwards along the dorsal surface to the
  head: this groove serves to carry the faeces out of the tube. The gill filaments are always
  provided with secondary processes, and may be provided with compound eyes.<a id="NtA_393"
  href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> The tubes of the Sabellidae are always of fine mud or of
  sand.</p>

  <p><i>Sabella pavonia</i> Sav. is about 10 to 12 inches long and about &frac14; inch across; the tube of
  fine mud is considerably longer and embedded deeply in the mud, with its free end projecting to
  some 2 or more inches, where it serves for the attachment of seaweed, Polyzoa, Hydrozoa, etc. The
  colour of the animal is orange-brown; the gills, which are about 1&frac12; inches long, are green (due to
  contained blood) marked with more or less extensive brown or purple-brown spots, which may even
  hide the green tint. There is a pair of dark filaments arising between the dorsalmost gill
  filaments, which have been erroneously regarded as "prostomial tentacles"; they are, in fact,
  prolongations of a peculiar membrane or lip round the base of the gills, which bounds a groove
  leading to the mouth. These lip-processes (Fig. 133, B, <i>l</i>) occur in other Sabellids.

  <p><i>Branchiomma vesiculosum</i> Mont. forms a sandy tube near low tide-mark. The animal,
  measuring 6-7 inches, is rich brown, darker anteriorly, abundantly speckled with white; the
  ventral surface is pink; the gills are green or <span class="pagenum" id="page338"><span
  class="smaller">{338}</span></span>olive-brown, marked with white bands in a fairly regular
  fashion. Each gill filament has, just below its tip, a compound eye, consisting of several lenses
  and retinae. North Sea and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><i>Dasychone bombyx</i> Dalyl. is a short, comparatively stout worm usually 1 to 1&frac12; inches
  long; reddish-brown in colour, with a darker spot on each side of every segment. The gills are
  lighter with greenish marks. This worm may readily be recognised, for each of the gill filaments
  carries some six to ten pairs of dark compound eyes at intervals along its length, and near to
  each pair there arise two short processes from the outer side of the filament, which are known as
  "dorsal appendices." The worm forms a tube of mud, more or less mixed with sand. It occurs at low
  water and to some depth round the coasts of the Atlantic, North Sea, and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><i>Chone infundibuliformis</i> Kr&ouml;yer may be recognised by the absence of lobes on the collar,
  the presence of a membrane connecting the gill filaments, and the passage of the faecal groove
  along the dorsal surface of the thorax. The worm is 6 inches long, with purple gills, spotted with
  yellowish-white. The tube is formed of yellowish membrane covered with sand, and is fixed to
  stones and other objects. <i>Potamilla reniformis</i> M&uuml;ll. is about 3 inches long, with about
  twelve brown gill filaments, some of which have eyes near the base. The tube is transparent and
  horny, with sometimes a slight covering of sand. Found in old oyster shells. North Sea, Atlantic,
  Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Spirographis</i> contains one of the largest European Sabellids, <i>S.
  spallanzanii</i> Viv., which occurs off the Channel Islands and in the Mediterranean. The two gill
  plumes are unequal; the large rone forms an upright, spirally-coiled column.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Eriographidae.</i>&mdash;<i>Myxicola infundibulum</i> Mont.
  has its gill filaments connected by a membrane reaching nearly to their tips. Each gill plume
  forms a semicircle; there are no eyes; the peristomium does not form a collar; no gland shields.
  The worm requires neither of these structures, since it is practically a free-swimmer, envelopes
  itself in mucus, and moves tail first. The faecal groove is not well marked, though continued
  dorsally. In the abdomen the <i>tori uncinigeri</i> extend dorsally and ventrally <span
  class="pagenum" id="page339"><span class="smaller">{339}</span></span>(beyond the neuropodial
  chaetae) and nearly encircle the body. The animal is 4 or 5 inches long, dull green, with purplish
  gills. Between tide-marks. North Sea and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p><i>Amphiglena mediterranea</i> Leyd. is only about &frac14; inch long, hermaphrodite, and has eyes on
  the peristomium and on the anal segment. It is a very elegant little worm, and as a living object
  under the microscope, with the cilia on the gills, is very beautiful. The gills consist of six
  filaments on each side, provided with the usual double row of ciliated processes.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Amphicorinidae.</i>&mdash;Small hermaphrodite Sabellids in

  <i>Haplobranchus aestuarinus</i> Bourne,<a id="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> which
  occurs in the rather foul mud at low tide in the estuaries of the Thames, the Liffey, and other
  rivers. The animal is about &frac14; inch long, with four finger-shaped processes on each side, and a
  pair of larger, vascular processes on the ventral surface. These five branches are gills (palps),
  although, owing to the small size of the worm and simple vascular system, the four lateral
  filaments have no blood-vessels. The animal consists of only eleven chaetigerous segments, and
  lives in a tube made of mud particles.<a id="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>
  <i>Fabricia sabella</i> Ehrenb. (<i>Amphicora fabricia</i> M&uuml;ll.) has three gills on each side,

  same level. It has eyes in its tail and swims backwards.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 4.</span> <i>Serpulidae.</i>&mdash;The thorax is provided with an
  undulated membrane on each side, chiefly employed in smoothing the inside of the tube; it
  represents the dorsal and ventral cirri of these segments. The gland shields are confined to the
  thoracic segments. In many genera the dorsalmost gill filament on one or both sides is terminally
  dilated and serves as an operculum. The tube is calcareous, and attached to rocks, shells, etc.,
  for a greater or smaller part of its extent.</p>

  <p><i>Serpula vermicularis</i> L. forms a pinkish tapering tube about 3 inches long; the narrower
  fixed end is coiled. It is marked at irregular intervals with encircling ridges, indicating

  <p><i>Pomatoceros triqueter</i> L.&mdash;The white shell is adherent, with a distinct keel along
  its upper surface; the aperture is overhung by a spine. The tubes are abundant everywhere,
  attached to rocks, stones, shells, etc., between tide-marks and down to 18 fathoms. The animal is
  very handsome, the thorax being deep blue, the abdomen red in the female, whitish in the ripe
  male. The branchiae are barred and spotted with blue, orange, and white; the operculum is
  calcareous, and furnished with a couple of horn-like processes.</p>

  <i>Myzostoma</i> F. S. Lkt. and <i>Stelechopus</i> v.&nbsp;Gr.</p>

  <p>Some of them move, more or less actively, on the surface of their hosts, others live in a
  sessile condition between the joints of the arms or pinnules, causing a greater or less
  malformation thereof, sometimes leading to the formation of a more or less globular cyst like a
  plant-gall, due to overgrowths of the joint, as in <i>M. deformator</i> v.&nbsp;Gr. and <i>M.

  Two species occur on our common <i>Antedon</i> (<i>Comatula</i>) <i>rosacea</i>; one, <i>M.
  cirriferum</i> Lkt., creeps about the oral surface, especially along the food grooves of the disc
  and arms; the other, <i>M. glabrum</i> Lkt., lives close to the mouth of the Crinoid, so that its
  pharynx can be inserted into the oesophagus of the host; this species rarely moves from this
  position, and carries a young one on its back.</p>

  is provided with ten or more pairs of cirri, short (<i>M. glabrum</i>) or long (<i>M.

  the great elongation of the hinder cirri, into which the viscera may extend (<i>M. filicauda</i>
  v.&nbsp;Gr.). On the ventral surface are five pairs of small conical "parapodia," arranged, like
  the internal organs, in a radiate manner. Each parapodium carries a couple of chaetae; one a hook,
  the other serving as a "guide" for this hook. The four "suckers" on each side are either glandular
  or sensory organs; and Wheeler considers them homologous with the lateral organs of Capitellids;

  <p>The mouth and anus are usually ventral; but in <i>M. glabrum</i> the anus is dorsal, and in a
  few species both apertures are carried on to the back by the great development of the ventral
  surface. The alimentary canal is provided with a protrusible pharynx; the intestine is branched;
  amongst its branches is the coelom, packed with eggs, and functioning as a uterus (usually called
  "ovary"). The true ovary is a small mass of cells on each side, a proliferation of the coelomic
  epithelium covering the intestinal wall. A median continuation of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page344"><span class="smaller">{344}</span></span>uterus passes backwards above the rectum,
  and opens either into it or by an independent pore dorsal to the anus. The "lateral oviducts" of
  Nansen are nephridia with ciliated funnels opening into the coelom (uterus), and with pores
  leading into the cloaca on its ventral surface; or, in <i>M. belli</i> Wheeler, opening to the
  exterior. The two testes are branched, and each sperm-duct opens laterally on a papilla, just
  outside the third parapodium of each side. Wheeler<a id="NtA_399"
  href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> has recently shown that in the young <i>Myzostoma</i> the
  spermatozoa ripen before the ova, so that it is functionally a male; before the spermatozoa are
  all discharged the ova mature, and the animal is for a time hermaphrodite; later on, however, when
  all the spermatozoa are used up, the worm is a female. Beard's "dwarf males" are therefore merely
  the young of hermaphrodite forms. In cysticolous species each cyst usually contains a large female
  individual and a small male. In these cases the young one (male) discharges all its spermatozoa
  before the ova ripen, so that a period of immaturity intervenes and a true hermaphrodite condition
  is omitted; the animal is at first male, and later female. The Myzostomaria are thus "protandric
  hermaphrodites."</p>

  <p class="sp5">The affinity of these animals has been much discussed; they superficially resemble
  the Tardigrada in many anatomical features, and differ greatly from Chaetopoda, but as they
  possess the characteristic chaetae or parapodia, and pass through a larval stage<a id="NtA_400"
  href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> similar to that of the Polychaetes, there is no doubt that
  they are closely allied to the group, and indeed may be regarded as degenerate Chaetopods. It has
  been suggested that they form a passage group between them and the Tardigrada; and von Graff forms
  a group Stelechopoda, to include the Myzostomaria, the Tardigrada, and the Linguatulida.</p>

  <p>The Oligochaeta form a well-marked branch of that exceedingly large assortment of animals
  vaguely spoken of as worms, and embracing a number of types many of which have no near
  relationship to each other. From this great and unnatural group, which has survived as "Vermes"
  even in some quite modern text-books, we can separate off those forms which show a plain
  segmentation or division of the body internally as well as externally into a series of more or
  less similar rings, as a Class Chaetopoda. This Class, consisting of the Orders mentioned on p. <a
  href="#page241">241</a>, includes the worms which form the subject of the present
  chapter&mdash;the Oligochaeta, as they were originally called by Grube, on account of the fewness
  of their chaetae as compared with the number possessed by the majority of the Polychaeta.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of this group, as of so many others, dates from Aristotle, who called the
  earthworms the "intestines of the earth." But it is only very recently that the numerous and
  remarkable genera of exotic earthworms have been anatomically investigated; indeed the common
  British species was not really well known before the publication of the memoirs of Lankester<a
  id="NtA_401" href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> and Clapar&egrave;de<a id="NtA_402"
  href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> in 1864 and 1868, in spite of the elaborate quarto devoted to
  it by Morren,<a id="NtA_403" href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> the botanist, in 1826. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page348"><span class="smaller">{348}</span></span>Some of the aquatic species
  afforded material to Bonnet and Spallanzani for their experiments upon the powers of regeneration
  of the animals when cut into fragments, while the work of O. F. M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_404"
  href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> upon various Naids is a monument of careful anatomical
  description. Our knowledge of the aquatic Oligochaeta does not appear to have advanced so rapidly
  as has that of the earthworms.</p>

  <p><b>External Characters.</b>&mdash;The most salient external characteristic of this group of
  worms, which vary from 1 mm. to 2 metres in length, is of course the segmentation. The entire body
  is divided into a number of rings, which are for the most part similar to each other; a fragment
  of an earthworm's body could not be accurately replaced unless it had been cut from the anterior
  region. There is precisely the same regular segmentation in the aquatic representatives of the
  Order. At the anterior end of the body in the common earthworm (and in nearly all Oligochaeta) is
  a small unpaired lobe, which overhangs the mouth, and is usually termed the prostomium; the mouth
  itself is surrounded by the first segment of the body, which never bears any chaetae in any
  Oligochaete. The prostomium is occasionally greatly developed, and in such cases doubtless forms a
  tactile organ of importance. This is especially the case with the South American genus
  <i>Rhinodrilus</i>, where the lengthy prostomium can be retracted at will. The aquatic <i>Nais
  lacustris</i> (= <i>Stylaria proboscidea</i>) has also an exceedingly long prostomium, which
  cannot, however, be retracted, though it is contractile. At a certain distance from the anterior
  end of the body, fixed for the species, but varying greatly from genus to genus and from species
  to species, is the clitellum. This region of the body (popularly believed to mark the spot where a
  worm divided by the gardener's spade has come together again) is associated with the reproductive
  function, and serves to secrete the cocoon in which the creature's eggs are deposited. It has in
  the earthworm a thick glandular appearance. A more minute examination of the worm's body will show
  the orifices of the reproductive ducts and of the excretory organs which will be found described
  below. In addition to these, all British earthworms and a large percentage of the tropical forms
  have a row of pores along the back, which are between the successive segments in the median line.
  These "dorsal pores" <span class="pagenum" id="page349"><span
  class="smaller">{349}</span></span>open directly into the body-cavity, and are mere perforations
  of the body-wall, not tubes lined by a special layer of cells. Professor Spencer of Melbourne<a
  id="NtA_405" href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> has observed a giant earthworm (<i>Megascolides
  australis</i>) of Gippsland which, when held in the hand, spurts out, to a height of several
  inches, the fluid of the body-cavity through its dorsal pores. The burrows, he remarks, are coated
  over with the same fluid, which is regarded by him as a lubricant. This, however, considering that
  the glandular cells of the epidermis can secrete a mucous fluid, seems to be an expensive use to
  which to put the important fluids of the interior of the body. It is more probable that the dorsal
  pores are a means of getting rid of waste products. Lim Boon Keng<a id="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> suggests that the coelomic fluid possesses a bactericidal
  function. The dorsal pores are missing in many earthworms, and without exception in those
  Oligochaeta which live in water; but these latter worms have a pore upon the head, which appears
  to be wanting in the earthworms. Dr. Michaelsen has thought that the head-pore serves to relieve
  the brain from undue watery pressure&mdash;to act, in fact, as a kind of safety-valve for the
  liberation of superfluous fluid.</p>

  <p>In some foreign worms the pores of the reproductive ducts are conspicuous external features
  (Fig. 197); even in our British species the turgescent male apertures upon the fifteenth segment
  are sometimes quite obvious.</p>

  <p><b>Structure of the Body-Wall.</b>&mdash;The body-wall consists in all Oligochaeta of three
  recognisable sheets of tissue. Outside is the epidermis, which always consists of a single layer
  of cells, except in the clitellar region of earthworms. It is a point of difference between the
  aquatic genera and the terrestrial forms that in the former the clitellum is only one cell thick,
  while in the higher Oligochaeta it is made up of more than one layer of cells. The epidermis is
  ciliated only in the genus <i>Aeolosoma</i>, and there only on the prostomium. It secretes a thin
  layer of chitin, which is defective opposite to the glandular cells, and becomes therefore
  perforated by numerous pores. The structure of the epidermis of <i>Lumbricus</i> has been studied
  by Cerfontaine, whose recent account<a id="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> of the
  same is the fullest and most accurate that exists.</p>

  <p>Underneath the epidermis comes a layer of circular muscle-fibres, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page350"><span class="smaller">{350}</span></span>and underneath this again a layer of
  longitudinal muscles. In both layers the fibres have a softer core, outside which lies the
  radially striated muscular substance. The fibres are embedded in a granular matrix. It used to be
  considered at one time that such medullated fibres were distinctive of leeches as opposed to
  Oligochaeta. Their existence has been really known in the Oligochaeta since the researches of
  Ratzel; but Cerfontaine has fully described them, and emphasised the fact that the fibres of both
  circular and longitudinal coats are alike in this respect.</p>

  <p><b>Chaetae.</b>&mdash;The passive organs of locomotion in these animals are the chaetae, which
  are absent in only one family, Discodrilidae, and in one other genus, <i>Anachaeta</i>. In this
  latter worm the chaetae are represented by large glandular cells, which seem to correspond to the
  cells from which the chaetae arise in other forms. They are in this case, as in the others, cells
  of the epidermis. The chaetae of the Oligochaeta are not quite so variable in form as in the
  marine Polychaeta (see Fig. 138, p. <a href="#page267">267</a>). Figs. 187 and 188 illustrate some
  of the principal shapes which these bristles assume. The most prevalent form is an elongated S,
  which has been aptly compared to the mathematical sign &#x222B;. This kind of chaeta is found in
  all earthworms, and in not a few aquatic genera such as the Lumbriculidae. In some of the latter
  and in the Tubificidae and Naids there is the same form of chaeta, which is cleft at the free end,
  and possibly enables the worm to grasp the leaves of aquatic plants, and otherwise facilitates
  progression in a laxer medium than the stiff soil frequented by the earthworms. Even earthworms,
  at any rate the genus <i>Pontoscolex</i>, have chaetae of this kind; some of the aquatic
  Oligochaeta have elongated and hair-like bristles, such as that of <i>Tubifex</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the Tubificid <i>Lophochaeta</i> (Fig. 187, 5) the chaetae are ornamented on both sides with
  delicate processes, which give them the appearance of Crustacean hairs. Among earthworms the
  simple S-like form is sometimes complicated by the development of sinuous ridges upon the distal
  end. No doubt these bristles enable their possessor to get a firmer grip of adjacent objects; they
  are very commonly found, in the family Geoscolicidae, upon the segments of the clitellum, and
  permit of a firmer union during sexual congress. In no Oligochaeta are the chaetae borne upon
  parapodia, as is the case with the Polychaeta; but in many of the aquatic forms there are a
  considerable number to each bundle. In earthworms the number of chaetae varies greatly. The common
  earthworms of this country, belonging to the genera <i>Lumbricus</i>, <i>Allolobophora</i>, and
  <i>Allurus</i>, have only eight chaetae upon each segment of the body, and these are then, as a
  rule, arranged in pairs or rather couples, two of each on each side of the body. The genus
  <i>Perichaeta</i> and some of its allies have a much larger number of chaetae to each segment,
  disposed in a continuous row round the middle of the segment. The intermediate condition is to be
  seen in the genus <i>Deinodrilus</i>, where there are twelve in each segment, and in certain
  members of the genus <i>Megascolex</i>, where there are eight in each segment in the anterior
  region of the body, the number increasing in the posterior segments. The four bundles of chaetae
  in the Naids and Tubificids have been likened to the <span class="pagenum" id="page352"><span
  class="smaller">{352}</span></span>notopodia and neuropodia of the Polychaetes; but it does not
  seem certain that this comparison is justifiable. It was at one time thought that the continuous
  circle of chaetae of the Perichaetidae was the primitive condition; but Professor Bourne has
  lately found that in <i>Perichaeta</i> the young embryos have not got this continuous circle; it
  is only acquired later.</p>

  <p><b>Branchiae.</b>&mdash;The Oligochaeta were called by Cuvier the "Ann&eacute;lides abranches
  s&eacute;tig&egrave;res." But the epithet "abranches" is now known to be inaccurate. In fact it really was so
  when Cuvier wrote; for naturalists were at that time well acquainted, chiefly through the
  elaborate work of O. F. M&uuml;ller, with the little fresh-water Naid <i>Dero</i>, the posterior
  extremity of which is provided with a varying number of branchial processes. These are furnished
  with looped blood-vessels and are covered externally by cilia, so that the water containing oxygen
  is constantly renovated. The second instance of a gilled Oligochaete was discovered in the very
  same family. Professor Bourne<a id="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> of Madras found
  in "tanks" a Naid which he named <i>Chaetobranchus</i>, in which the head segments, to the number
  of fifty or so, are provided with long ciliated processes, which as a rule enclose the dorsal
  chaetae of their segments, and in addition a capillary loop. Curiously enough, this very same worm
  made its appearance in the <i>Victoria regia</i> tank at the Botanical Gardens in the Regent's
  Park, whither it had in all probability been accidentally imported. Two members of the family
  Tubificidae were the next examples of gilled Oligochaeta made known to science; one of these,
  <i>Branchiura sowerbyi</i>,<a id="NtA_409" href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> appeared also in
  the Botanical Gardens, so that its native home is unknown. It differs from <i>Chaetobranchus</i>
  in that the gills are at the posterior end of the body, and are contractile; during the life of
  the worm they are in continual motion. A species of the South American genus
  <i>Hesperodrilus</i>,<a id="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> <i>H. branchiatus</i>, is
  also gilled, and, so far as can be made out from a spirit-preserved specimen, the gills are
  precisely of the same pattern and contractility as those of its ally <i>Branchiura</i>. Possibly
  <i>Branchiura</i> ought to be included in the same genus with <i>Hesperodrilus</i>. A worm which
  was originally described by Grube as <i>Alma nilotica</i>, should really have been placed before
  the three last-mentioned <span class="pagenum" id="page353"><span
  class="smaller">{353}</span></span>instances; but as this worm was only known from a fragment, and
  as the description was not by any means full, it was not thoroughly believed in; it was surmised
  that it might be a member of some marine genus, perhaps of the Capitellidae. Oddly enough, the
  same worm was independently described by a different name, <i>Digitibranchus niloticus</i>, a few
  years later by Levinsen. Quite recently Michaelsen has found by a reference to the original types
  that this worm is really gilled, and that it is specifically identical with a worm which had been
  given a totally different name, viz. <i>Siphonogaster</i>. The fact that the gills of the latter
  had been overlooked was readily explained by the circumstance that they are retractile, and not
  merely contractile. But all the species of the genus <i>Siphonogaster</i>, or <i>Alma</i>, as it
  ought really, following the rules of priority, to be called, have not got gills, as is the case
  too with the genus <i>Hesperodrilus</i>. The gills of <i>Alma</i> are branched, and there is
  therefore no longer any justification whatever for defining the Oligochaeta as a group of Annelids
  without gills. The simple gill-like processes of <i>Chaetobranchus</i> might have been held to be
  not accurately comparable to the more complex structures which we find in the marine worms.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The central nervous system of the Oligochaeta is very uniform in
  its structure in the entire group. The only family which is at all anomalous is that of the
  Aphaneura. In <i>Aeolosoma</i> there appears to be only a pair of cerebral ganglia, which retain
  the primitive position of these organs in being still in direct connexion with the epidermis. In
  all other Oligochaeta there are a pair of cerebral ganglia, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page354"><span class="smaller">{354}</span></span>connected by a circumoesophageal commissure
  with a ventral ganglionated cord. From the cerebral ganglia arises a system of nerve-fibres and
  nerve-cells, which represents the stomatogastric nerves of other Invertebrates.</p>

  <p><b>Senses and Sense-Organs.</b>&mdash;The only organs that can be regarded with anything like
  probability as sense-organs are the pigmented eyes of certain Naids and the tactile cells of many
  worms. The latter are usually elongated cells provided at their free extremity with a stiff
  process; they occur associated in groups, and often these bundles of cells have a segmental
  arrangement. The head end of many of the lower Oligochaeta, for instance the genus
  <i>Aeolosoma</i>, has delicate processes projecting here and there; these appear to be also of a
  tactile nature, and are of course connected with cells of the epidermis. The eyes of certain Naids
  are little more than lenticular bodies embedded in a mass of pigment. In the genus <i>Eudrilus</i>
  and in many Eudrilidae are peculiar integumental bodies, which were independently discovered by
  Dr. Horst<a id="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> and myself, and compared by us to the
  Pacinian bodies of Mammals. Whether these structures are connected with nerves or not is doubtful.
  In spite of the poor development and the simplicity of their sense organs, the higher Oligochaeta
  at any rate can feel, and can distinguish light from darkness. Darwin<a id="NtA_412"
  href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> came to the conclusion that "light affects worms by its
  intensity and its duration." And furthermore, it is only the anterior end of the body which is
  thus affected. Of the sense of hearing these animals appear to be utterly devoid. Some kept by
  Darwin "took not the least notice of the shrill notes from a metal whistle, which was repeatedly
  sounded near them; nor did they of the deepest and loudest tones of a bassoon." But it is always
  necessary to discriminate between sound and vibrations passing through any solid body, which would
  appeal rather to a sense of touch. Here worms are most sensitive. It is quite easy, by digging
  with some vigour, to arouse the worms in the neighbourhood, who will crawl to the surface and away
  from the scene of action; a proceeding on their part which is sometimes put down to a desire to
  escape from their enemy the mole.</p>

  <p>Smell appears to be another sense which is somewhat deficient. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page355"><span class="smaller">{355}</span></span>But worms are epicures, and exhibit a
  decided taste and preference for certain articles of diet. Like their fellow tiller of the soil,
  the agricultural labourer, worms have a keen relish for onions, which, however, they must
  recognise by the smell. They prefer green cabbage to red, celery to both, and raw meat appears to
  be the greatest delicacy that can be offered to them. It is only substances they are not likely to
  meet with, such as perfumes, tobacco, and paraffin, that produce no impression upon the worm's
  sense of smell.</p>

  <p><b>Coelom and Vascular System.</b>&mdash;When an earthworm is dissected the various organs are
  seen to lie in a fairly spacious cavity, which is interrupted and divided into a series of
  chambers by the mesenteries or septa which stretch across from wall to wall of the body, and
  correspond roughly in their position to the grooves which separate the body externally. This
  cavity, common to all the higher animals, is known as the coelom; it is lined by cells, which
  cover the intestines as well as the inside of the body-wall; and upon the intestine assume the
  form so characteristic of the group, namely, that of large yellow cells loaded with secreted
  matters, and called "chloragogen-cells" by Clapar&egrave;de. The coelom communicates with the exterior by
  means of the dorsal pores, the nephridia, and the ducts of the reproductive organs. As in all
  animals which possess a coelom, the reproductive tissues, ova and sperm, are developed on its
  walls.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The vascular system of the Oligochaeta forms a system of perfectly closed vessels, which ramify
  into fine capillary networks in the body-wall, in the coats of the alimentary canal, and upon
  <span class="pagenum" id="page356"><span class="smaller">{356}</span></span>the other organs of
  the body. The main trunks are a dorsal and a ventral longitudinal, which communicate directly in
  the anterior end of the body by large transverse contractile trunks, the so-called hearts (see
  Fig. 190, 6). The dorsal vessel is also contractile, but not the ventral, or, when it occurs, the
  subnervian. The vascular system has many degrees of complexity in different families; it is
  simpler in the smaller aquatic forms. The blood is usually red, and the pigment which is suspended
  in the plasma is haemoglobin. The blood is corpusculated.</p>

  <p><b>Excretory Organs.</b>&mdash;There appears to be a great deal more variation in the structure
  of the excretory system than there is in many other groups. For a long time only <i>Lumbricus</i>
  and a few of the aquatic genera were known as regards their excretory systems. In these there is a
  pair of excretory organs or nephridia in nearly all the segments. These are much coiled tubes, in
  which it is always possible to recognise three divisions. The nephridium commences with an orifice
  of a funnel-like character, fringed with long cilia, and opening into the body-cavity; from this
  springs a tube, which immediately perforates the septum lying between the segment which contains
  the funnel and the following one; this tube has the peculiarity first pointed out by Clapar&egrave;de of
  being excavated in the substance of cells; the glandular part of the nephridium is a row of cells
  which are bored through by a continuous canal, the walls of which are here and there furnished
  with cilia. It often happens that the main canal gives off minute lateral ramifications, which may
  even form a kind of network round the principal canal. The terminal section of the nephridium is a
  muscular sac which opens on to the exterior by a pore, and from which the products of excretion
  are from time to time evacuated by contractions of its walls. This is a brief statement of the
  main facts in the structure of those Oligochaeta in which there is a single pair of nephridia to
  each segment of the body; small differences of more or less importance occur. In
  <i>Chaetogaster</i>, for example, there is no trace of a funnel; in some genera the terminal sac
  is much reduced or unusually extended, being even sometimes provided with a caecum of moderate
  dimensions. In <i>Acanthodrilus novae-zelandiae</i> and a few other species the point of opening
  of the nephridia varies from segment to segment, though it always bears some relation to the
  chaetae. In these <span class="pagenum" id="page357"><span
  class="smaller">{357}</span></span>species the nephridia which open more dorsally are a little
  different in structure from those which open more ventrally. One set have a caecum, and the other
  have not.</p>

  <p>The nephridia of the terrestrial forms are enveloped by a richly developed network of blood
  capillaries, which is absent in  the  smaller aquatic genera.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable genus, <i>Brachydrilus</i>, has lately been described by Dr. Benham,<a
  id="NtA_413" href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> in which each segment has two pairs of nephridia
  instead of a single pair. More recently, certain Australian forms, which I propose to unite on
  this account into a genus <i>Trinephrus</i>, have been discovered which have no less than three
  distinct and separate pairs in each segment.<a id="NtA_414"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In many Megascolicidae there is a nephridial system of a different character. In
  <i>Perichaeta</i> when dissected the nephridia appear, on account of their minute size, to be
  altogether absent. There is, however, in most Perichaetidae, in many Acanthodrilidae, and in many
  Cryptodrilidae a mass of minute tubules which cover the inside of the body-wall, and open on to
  the exterior by innumerable openings; there may be in a single segment one hundred or more of
  these external orifices, which are scattered about irregularly. It is at present uncertain whether
  these minute tubes are connected among <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span
  class="smaller">{358}</span></span>themselves, thus forming a network passing through the septum
  and from segment to segment, or whether each tube is isolated from its fellows, and forms a
  distinct nephridium, of which there are many in each segment and entirely separate. This is,
  however, certain, that the complex nephridial systems of at any rate <i>Octochaetus</i> and
  <i>Megascolides</i> are derived from the multiplication of a single pair of tubes which are alone
  present in the embryo. In <i>Perichaeta</i> the minute nephridia are furnished with coelomic
  funnels; in <i>Octochaetus</i> they are not, except in the case of certain nephridia which open
  into the terminal section of the intestine.</p>

  <p>Both at the anterior and at the posterior end the nephridia occasionally open into the
  alimentary canal. In various genera the first pair of nephridia are larger than the others, and
  open into the buccal cavity; it seems likely that they serve as salivary glands. A somewhat
  similar condition of things exists in <i>Peripatus</i> (vol. v, p. 17). In <i>Octochaetus
  multiporus</i>, for example, there is a large tuft of nephridial tubes in the anterior region of
  the body, which opens by a long muscular duct into the buccal cavity. In the same species a good
  many of the nephridial tubes open into the posterior section of the intestine, reminding one of
  the anal vesicles of the Gephyrea (p. <a href="#page436">436</a>) and of the Malpighian tubes of
  the Arthropods.</p>

  <p>In many Eudrilidae the ducts of the paired nephridia form a network in the body-wall, which
  opens on to the exterior by many pores.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The digestive tube is perfectly straight in nearly all
  Oligochaeta. Only in <i>Plagiochaeta</i> and a species of <i>Digaster</i> is it twisted in the
  intestinal region in a corkscrew-like fashion. The mouth is under the buccal lobe (where, as in
  the majority of cases, this is present); the anus is mostly terminal, or rarely, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Criodrilus</i>, a little in advance of the end of the body on the ventral side. In the simpler
  forms three regions can be distinguished, which are themselves simple in structure. The mouth
  leads into a buccal cavity, which in its turn opens into the pharynx; the latter is muscular, with
  thick walls. The narrower oesophagus opens into the wider intestine, which opens posteriorly, as
  already stated. In the earthworms there is as a rule some complication. The oesophagus bears
  certain glandular appendages, the calciferous glands; and a part of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page359"><span class="smaller">{359}</span></span>it is modified into a gizzard. The gizzard
  is merely a portion of the oesophagus with very much thickened muscular walls and with a stout
  lining of chitin. It is not universally present among earthworms, and when present varies much in
  position. The rule is that one gizzard only is present. In <i>Digaster</i>, as is implied by the
  name, and in some other forms there are two in successive segments; in <i>Trigaster</i>, as the
  name also indicates, there are three gizzards; in <i>Moniligaster</i> and the Eudrilids
  <i>Hyperiodrilus</i> and <i>Heliodrilus</i> there are four to six; and a few other forms also have
  a considerable number of gizzards. The calciferous glands are diverticula of the oesophagus with
  folded and sometimes ciliated walls; their epithelium secretes calcareous particles, which are
  frequently of crystalline form. Darwin supposed that this secretion was provided in order to
  negative the humus-acids of the soil which is the food of earthworms. These organs are usually
  paired, but in the Eudrilidae there are unpaired as well as paired glands; the unpaired
  calciferous glands lie ventrally. These glands are totally wanting among the aquatic families,
  with the sole exception of the Enchytraeidae. In a few of these there are either paired or single
  glands of a very similar nature; Dr. Michaelsen has suggested that the function of these is rather
  absorptive than secretory. From the median unpaired gland of <i>Buchholzia</i> arises the dorsal
  vessel, which at first forms a sinus round the glandular epithelium; the epithelium, like that of
  the nephridia, is perforated by the ducts. In certain Oligochaeta there are some curious
  modifications of the calciferous glands. In <i>Stuhlmannia</i> and a few other Eudrilidae the
  oesophagus is beset with a larger number of paired structures than in any other genera of the
  family, where the calciferous glands are more limited in number. These glands consist of a short
  tube lined with epithelium opening into the oesophagus. Round this is a mass of cellular tissue,
  but the outlines of the constituent cells are lost; the whole is permeated with abundant
  blood-vessels. This layer seems to be peritoneal, and the entire gland seems to have lost its
  function as a secretory organ, and to have taken on some function in connexion with the vascular
  system. An analogous modification is to be found among the Enchytraeidae. In certain forms there
  is a structure known as the cardiac body; this is a chord of cells lying in the dorsal
  blood-vessel at the point where it springs from the intestine. It is tempting to regard this
  cellular rod as being <span class="pagenum" id="page360"><span
  class="smaller">{360}</span></span>the altered dorsal glandular pouch already spoken of, which is
  surrounded by a blood sinus.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;All the Oligochaeta are hermaphrodite animals. But, as is the
  case with other hermaphrodites, the male and female organs are in many cases mature at different
  times, thus leading to a practical unisexuality. Many of the aquatic forms appear to have fixed
  times for breeding, which may be in the winter or in the summer; but the earthworms are as a rule
  sexually mature the whole year round. Various accessory organs are developed in the majority of
  cases. In all, the reproductive glands lie in successive segments and are attached to the septa,
  from the peritoneal covering of which they originate. Their actual position differs greatly in
  different genera; the position is constant only in the earthworms, where the testes are in the
  tenth and eleventh segments and the ovaries in the thirteenth, in exactly corresponding
  situations. A few earthworms have only one pair of testes. The only exception, among terrestrial
  forms, to the position of the generative organs is in the family Moniligastridae, which show so
  many other affinities to the lower forms of Oligochaeta. In this family the ovaries have moved one
  or two segments forward. Among the fresh-water families the position of the testes and of the
  ovaries is not so uniform. They are generally more anterior than in the terrestrial genera,
  particularly the ovaries.</p>

  <p>One of the chief differences between the Oligochaeta and the Polychaeta is that the
  reproductive organs of the former have special ducts to convey their products to the exterior. In
  <i>Aeolosoma</i>, the only exception to this rule, Dr. Stolc<a id="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> has shown some reasons for believing that certain nephridia,
  but slightly altered in form, serve as the conduits of the spermatozoa, whilst the ova are
  extruded through a pore upon the ventral surface of the body. In the Enchytraeidae the same pore
  for the extrusion of the ova appears to exist; but a nearer examination shows that it is really
  not a mere perforation of the integument, like the dorsal pores, for example, but that its
  internal orifice is fringed with cells which seem to represent a rudimentary oviduct; perhaps
  <i>Aeolosoma</i> typifies a last stage in the reduction. Even so high in the scale as in the genus
  <i>Nemertodrilus</i> (Eudrilidae), there is an oviduct which can only be compared with that of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page361"><span class="smaller">{361}</span></span>Enchytraeidae.
  Elsewhere the oviducts are a pair of tubes with a wide, funnel-shaped, and ciliated mouth, which
  leads to the exterior by way of a ciliated tube of varying length.</p>

  <p>The sperm-ducts are of an essentially similar structure; but they are commonly much longer,
  passing through a variable number of segments on their way to the exterior. In most earthworms
  there are, moreover, two of them on each side instead of only a single pair, as is the case with
  the oviducts. Among the Tubificidae, Naids, and other aquatic families there are only two
  sperm-ducts, one on each side of the body. But this is not a character of the aquatic families,
  for the Lumbriculidae have generally two pairs, as in the earthworms. It is, however, a rule with
  hardly an exception, that among the aquatic Oligochaets the sperm-ducts open, as do the oviducts
  in all Oligochaets, upon the segments following that which bears internally the ciliated funnel.
  It is only in the Moniligastridae among earthworms that the sperm-duct only traverses two segments
  in its course. But where it is short as regards the actual distance traversed between the two
  extremities, the tube itself is commonly long and coiled.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as in our common earthworms, the sperm-duct opens directly on to the exterior of the
  body, the lips of the external orifice being swollen by the development of cutaneous gland-cells.
  In the majority of cases the sperm-duct or ducts open near or into a glandular structure which in
  earthworms has been called "prostate"; in the aquatic forms, on the other hand, "atrium." As these
  terms are objectionable from the different way in which they have been used for structures of
  Vertebrates, I have suggested for both the term "spermiducal glands," indicating the identity of
  the structure in all Oligochaeta. The number of pairs of these glands varies, as does also their
  shape and size. The typical form is perhaps illustrated in the lower Oligochaeta, where there is
  but a single pair into which the sperm-duct or ducts of the same side open. The Naids,
  Tubificidae, Lumbriculidae, and Moniligastridae have a simple gland of this description on each
  side of the body. These glands may consist of a tuft of pear-shaped glandular cells attached to
  the organ at one side, as in most Tubificidae, or of a complete investment of gland-cells, as in
  <i>Branchiura</i>. Among earthworms it is only the Moniligastridae and the Eudrilidae in which the
  sperm-duct opens directly into <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span
  class="smaller">{362}</span></span>the end of the spermiducal gland; in the Perichaetidae the
  gland is differentiated into two sections; there is a muscular duct leading to the exterior, and a
  lobate glandular part, which is formed by a complicated branching of a single sac such as exists
  in the Tubificidae; in the Acanthodrilidae and in many Cryptodrilidae the spermiducal glands are
  of a tubular form and are not branched, though there is the same differentiation into a duct and a
  secreting portion. There are in the Acanthodrilidae two pairs of these, and as many as three pairs
  in <i>Dichogaster</i>; in the latter case in three successive segments. In the Acanthodrilidae the
  glands are upon the seventeenth and nineteenth segments. In most Cryptodrilidae the sperm-ducts do
  not open into the duct of the spermiducal gland, but on to the body-wall near to its orifice, the
  distance varying in different genera. In the Acanthodrilidae the male pore is on the eighteenth
  segment, removed therefore by the distance of a segment from the aperture of either of the glands.
  It may be that a large series of structures which exist in <i>Microchaeta benhami</i><a
  id="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> and in other Geoscolecids, and which have been
  termed copulatory glands, are the equivalents of the spermiducal glands.</p>

  <p>In many earthworms there are, at the external opening of the male ducts, bundles of specially
  modified chaetae, which have been called, from their supposed function, penial chaetae; they are
  usually ornamented at the free end with spinelets or ridges, and frequently offer valuable
  specific characters. In the Lumbricidae and the Geoscolicidae there are modified chaetae upon the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page363"><span class="smaller">{363}</span></span>clitellum; in a few
  forms, such as, for example, <i>Acanthodrilus schmardae</i>, the spermathecae have bundles of
  similar chaetae in their neighbourhood, often associated with glands not unlike the spermiducal
  glands.</p>

  <p>In most, perhaps in all Oligochaeta the sperm is not matured in the testes, or even in the
  body-cavity; it is received into special sacs which are called sperm-sacs, and there ripens. These
  sacs, the vesiculae seminales, have been shown to be outgrowths of the septa; their cavity is thus
  a portion of the body-cavity shut off more or less completely from the general body-cavity.</p>

  <p>The reproductive organs of the Eudrilidae, and particularly the female organs, are so divergent
  in many particulars from those of other Oligochaeta that it is convenient to treat them
  separately. The testes are normal, save that they are often adherent to the posterior wall of
  their segment, as, however, is the case with some other earthworms. In many Eudrilidae, for
  instance in the genus <i>Hyperiodrilus</i>, the funnels of the sperm-ducts are dependent from the
  anterior wall of the segment which contains them; the narrow tube which follows projects into the
  segment in front, and is there immediately dilated into a wide chamber, which again narrows, and
  bending round, re-traverses the same septum; the two ducts of each side (if there are two, which
  is not invariably the case) remain separate and open separately into the glandular part of the
  spermiducal gland. There is occasionally only a single median gland; and as a general rule the two
  glands open by a median unpaired orifice. Penial chaetae may or may not be present.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The structure of the female organs differs considerably in detail in the different genera. But
  <i>Hyperiodrilus</i> may be taken as an instance of a genus in which these organs are as
  complicated as they are anywhere. The ovaries (Fig. 193, 4) are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page364"><span class="smaller">{364}</span></span>perfectly normal in structure and in
  position. So also are the oviducts; but both are enclosed in sacs which communicate in rather an
  elaborate fashion. Each ovisac is somewhat rounded in form, and the two communicate by a narrow
  tube; from the ovisac also arises another narrow tube, which soon dilates into a chamber lying in
  the thirteenth segment; this contains the mouth of the oviduct and is continuous with the egg-sac;
  the latter is quite normal in position. Beyond the egg-sacs the two tubes unite round the
  intestine and open into a large median sac, which contains sperm and may be called the
  spermathecal sac (1). There is, however, a true spermatheca, single and median. This opens on to
  the exterior in the middle of the thirteenth segment, but lies chiefly in the right-hand sac
  behind the ovarian portion of the same. I never found this spermatheca to contain sperm. Dr. Rosa
  inferred on anatomical grounds, and I have been able to prove developmentally (in
  <i>Libyodrilus</i>), that these sacs which involve the ovaries and oviducts, and which also
  contain sperm, are derivatives of the septa; that in fact the spaces which they enclose are
  coelomic. In some Eudrilids these sacs are the only "spermathecae"; in others, as in
  <i>Hyperiodrilus</i>, there are in addition blind pouches lying within them which must be regarded
  as true spermathecae; these are smaller in some than in others. In fact there are various
  transitions in the entire replacement of true spermathecae apparently homologous with those of
  other earthworms by pouches which are derived from the septa, and which are therefore of an
  entirely different morphological significance; here is an excellent case of the substitution of
  organs, analogous to the replacement of the primitive notochord of the Vertebrate by the vertebral
  column.</p>

  <p>So far as is known, all the Oligochaeta deposit their eggs in special chitinous cases, the
  cocoons. They share this peculiarity with the Hirudinea. The cocoons have long been known, but
  were originally mistaken for the eggs themselves. The cocoons contain several eggs and a variable
  quantity of albumen for the nutrition of the growing embryos. In the majority of earthworms they
  are more or less oval with projections at the two ends, and are of a brownish colour. In others
  the tint is rather to be described as green. The genera <i>Criodrilus</i> and
  <i>Sparganophilus</i> have a cocoon which is greatly elongated. These structures seem to be
  undoubtedly formed by the clitellum, the earlier <span class="pagenum" id="page365"><span
  class="smaller">{365}</span></span>opinion of D'Udekem being that they were the product of certain
  glands developed in <i>Lumbricus</i> at the breeding season, which he thence called the
  capsulogenous glands. It is more probable that these glands, which have been up to the present but
  little investigated, are the seat of the formation of the albumen which is found within the
  cocoons. The cocoons are deposited at varying depths in the ground, or on the surface. Among the
  aquatic genera they are often attached to aquatic plants. The process of formation has been
  carefully watched by Vejdovsky<a id="NtA_417" href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> in the genus
  <i>Rhynchelmis</i>. The worm throws off the cocoon over its head, crawling backwards to free
  itself therefrom. The eggs, spermatozoa and albumen, reach the interior of the cocoon as it passes
  over the orifices of the respective ducts. Out of the numerous eggs which a single cocoon
  originally contains, only a few, sometimes only one, reaches to maturity. Among the Enchytraeidae,
  however, quite a large number of young emerge from a single cocoon. The development of all the
  Oligochaeta is direct, there being no free larval stage. It seems to be the rule for a process of
  fission to take place in the embryos of <i>Allolobophora trapezoides</i><a id="NtA_418"
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> at least, according to the observations of Vejdovsky, in warm
  weather. In cold weather he found in each cocoon as a rule single embryos, and only 10 per cent of
  double embryos.</p>

  <p><b>Habitat.</b>&mdash;Earthworms are found in almost every part of the world where they have
  been looked for. They occur far to the north, in Siberia and Nova Zembla,<a id="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> while South Georgia and Kerguelen mark their southern limits.
  From arid tracts of country they are naturally absent, and also, which is more <span
  class="pagenum" id="page366"><span class="smaller">{366}</span></span>curious, from certain
  districts of North America. In the tropics these animals seem to be on the whole less abundant
  than in more temperate climates. But this deficiency of individuals is counterbalanced by the
  greater variety of generic and specific types. From tropical Africa, little explored as it has
  been from this point of view, no less than thirty genera, including about ninety species, have
  been recorded; whereas in Great Britain only four genera and seventeen species occur, and in all
  probability but few remain to be discovered. The vertical range of these Annelids is also
  considerable. Several species have been met with in Europe and elsewhere at an altitude of 10,000
  feet.</p>

  <p>For the bulk of the species the term earthworm is an accurate description of their habitat. But
  there are not a few which occasionally or habitually prefer other localities. The genus
  <i>Allurus</i> is equally at home in soil or in water; I have taken it in the fast-flowing river
  Plym in Devonshire. The genus <i>Acanthodrilus</i> includes a few species which have at present
  only been met with in water; <i>A. schmardae</i> comes from fresh water in Queensland, <i>A.
  stagnalis</i> from ponds in South America; <i>A. dalei</i> is like <i>Allurus</i> in that it is to
  be found both on land and in streams and ponds. The Enchytraeidae are just as amphibious;
  <i>Criodrilus</i> and <i>Sparganophilus</i> appear to be purely aquatic. A more curious locality
  for a creature that is so characteristically terrestrial is the margin of the sea. For a long time
  a species belonging to a peculiar genus <i>Pontodrilus</i> has been known from the shores of the
  Mediterranean in the neighbourhood of Nice. It lives there among seaweed above high-water mark,
  but it must at least occasionally be splashed by the waves. Another species of the same genus
  occurs on the coast of Brazil and some of the West Indian islands; <i>Pontoscolex corethrurus</i>
  and <i>Diachaeta littoralis</i> were described by Schmarda<a id="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> from the shores of Jamaica. The former species is one of the
  most widely distributed of earthworms, and, except in this particular part of the world, has been
  always taken on the land far from the sea. There are also partly marine forms among the
  Tubificidae; <i>Clitellio arenarius</i> is common on our coasts.</p>

  <p>While there are several kinds of earthworms that are thus met with in fresh water, others will
  live for some time submerged <span class="pagenum" id="page367"><span
  class="smaller">{367}</span></span>in water. Perrier found by experiment that various species
  could undergo with impunity a prolonged immersion in water, and I confirmed his experiments myself
  with a common species of <i>Allolobophora</i>. A correspondent of "Nature" stated that a certain
  number of species (not particularised) of earthworms in Ceylon could suffer with impunity the
  effects of sea-water. The importance of this fact will be again dealt with in considering the
  geographical distribution of the group.</p>

  <p>Among the aquatic genera of Oligochaeta we do not as a rule meet with amphibious species. The
  Enchytraeidae however, as already mentioned, are an exception; so too appears to be the genus
  <i>Phreoryctes</i>, which in its structure is to some extent intermediate between the earthworms
  and the aquatic families.</p>

  <p><b>Terrestrial and Aquatic Forms.</b>&mdash;There are many obvious structural peculiarities
  which would prevent the normally aquatic worms from being thoroughly at home on dry land. The
  gills of <i>Branchiura</i> and the other gilled species would be injured, in all probability, by
  friction with the earth; the delicate and long chaetae of Naids and <i>Tubifex</i> are also most
  unsuited for progression through dry soil; and it is to be noted that those Oligochaeta, which,
  belonging to aquatic groups, are yet found away from water, have chaetae of the simple sigmoid
  pattern which characterises the earthworms.</p>

  <p>There are other peculiarities found only in the aquatic species which have not so obvious a
  relation to their habitat. In no genus that is mainly aquatic in habit are the ova small and
  nearly unprovided with yolk as in <i>Lumbricus</i>; the ova of aquatic forms are invariably large
  and filled with abundant yolk.</p>

  <p>The more delicate organisation of the aquatic Oligochaeta is not so hard to understand. The
  comparatively unresisting nature of the medium in which they live, water or fine mud, does not
  necessitate so strong a development of the layers of the body-wall as is essential to the
  earth-living forms, which have also thick septa in the anterior region, to protect the organs of
  reproduction as the strong muscular contractions of the body force the worm's way through the
  dense soil. With the weak structure of the integument are perhaps also correlated the simplicity
  of other organs of the body in the aquatic Oligochaeta. With thin body-walls, through which gases
  can diffuse with great ease, there would seem to be less need for the development of a system of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page368"><span class="smaller">{368}</span></span>integumental blood
  capillaries. These are indeed for the most part absent in the aquatic forms, being only faintly
  developed in a few, an example possibly of degeneration.</p>

  <p><b>Earthworms and the Soil.</b>&mdash;Darwin has explained the enormous effects which these
  soft-bodied and small creatures have had upon the superficial structure of the earth. Their
  castings, brought up to the surface, are blown about by the wind when dry, and are thus spread
  over the ground in a fine layer. It has been calculated that in the space of an acre .2 of an inch
  in thickness of earth is annually brought to the surface. It is clear therefore that in a long
  period of years there would be a very large effect produced. On the sides of a hill this matter
  brought up from below would tend to roll down the slopes when dry, and would increase the d&eacute;bris
  carried away to the sea by streams and rivers, so that continents formerly deposited under the sea
  may owe no small proportion of their size to the continued work of earthworms in past ages.</p>

  <p>Darwin has also pointed out the benefits to the agriculturist which accrue from the industry of
  these Annelids. The soil is thoroughly mixed and submitted to the action of the atmosphere. The
  secretions of the worms themselves cannot but have a good effect upon its fertility, while the
  burrows open up the deeper-lying layers to the rain. Mr. Alvan Millson,<a id="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> in detailing the labours of the remarkable Yoruba worm
  (<i>Siphonogaster millsoni</i> Beddard), hints that they may serve as a check upon the fatal
  malaria of the west coast of Africa. By their incessant burrowings and ejecting of the undigested
  remains of their food many poisonous germs may be brought up from below, where they flourish in
  the absence of sunlight and oxygen, and submitted to the purifying influence of sun and air.</p>

  <p><b>Phosphorescence.</b>&mdash;Phosphorescence has been observed in several species of
  Oligochaeta. The most noteworthy instance of recent times is the discovery by Giard of the small
  worm which he called <i>Photodrilus phosphoreus</i> at Wimereux. During damp weather it was
  sufficient to disturb the gravel upon the walks of a certain garden to excite the luminosity of
  these Annelids. In all probability this species is identical with one whose luminosity had been
  noticed some years before (in 1837) by Dug&egrave;s, and named by him <i>Lumbricus phosphoreus</i>.
  According <span class="pagenum" id="page369"><span class="smaller">{369}</span></span>to Giard,
  the light is produced by a series of glands in the anterior region of the body debouching upon the
  exterior. This same worm has since been found in other localities, where it has been shown to be
  phosphorescent, by Moniez<a id="NtA_422" href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> and by Matzdorf<a
  id="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a>. It is remarkable that in some other cases the
  luminosity, though it exists, is very rarely seen. The exceedingly common Brandling
  (<i>Allolobophora foetida</i>) of dunghills has been observed on occasions to emit a
  phosphorescent light. This observation is due to Professor Vejdovsky,<a id="NtA_424"
  href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> and was made "upon a warm July night of 1881." He thinks that
  the seat of the light is in the secretion of the glandular cells of the epidermis, for when this
  and other worms are handled the phosphorescence clings to the fingers, as of course does the
  mucous secretion voided by the glands.</p>

  <p>Phosphorescence has been observed also in some other families of Oligochaetes. The late
  Professor Allen Harker noticed a small worm in marshy ground in Northumberland which emitted a
  distinct light, and which was subsequently identified as a member of the family Enchytraeidae.</p>

  <p><b>Geographical Distribution.</b><a id="NtA_425" href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a>&mdash;In
  the succeeding pages some of the details of the geographical range of the Oligochaeta will be
  found. The present section deals with a few generalities, which appear to result from an
  examination of the facts.</p>

  <p>As to the aquatic genera but little is known at present with regard to their range; they have
  not been widely collected in extra-European countries. What little is known points to the
  conclusion that while many parts of the world have their peculiar genera (such as
  <i>Hesperodrilus</i> in South America, <i>Phreodrilus</i> and <i>Pelodrilus</i> in New Zealand),
  some of the common European species are widely distributed. I have, for example, received
  <i>Henlea ventriculosa</i> from Kirghiz Tartary, and from New Zealand; and a New Zealand
  <i>Tubifex</i> appeared to me to be indistinguishable from the common <i>T. rivulorum</i> of our
  rivers and ponds. It is possible that these and similar instances may, at least in some cases, be
  due to accidental importation at the hands of man, a matter into which we shall enter later. But
  the aquatic genera have, many of them, facilities for extending their range in a natural fashion,
  which are greater than those possessed by earthworms. <span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span
  class="smaller">{370}</span></span>It has been pointed out that the chaetae of the aquatic
  Oligochaeta are generally hooked at the extremity and bifid, which would give them a greater
  chance of holding on to the feet or feathers of aquatic birds; I am not myself disposed to lay
  much stress on the possibilities of migration by these means, since the tender bodies of the small
  worms would be liable to be soon dried up by wind while in the act of migration. More likely in
  every way is a migration when enclosed in the cocoon. The cocoons being small, and often deposited
  at the edges of ponds frequented by aquatic birds, there would be many chances of their being
  carried away with tolerable frequency; moreover, as Dr. Michaelsen has pointed out, the cocoons of
  some species, particularly among the Enchytraeidae, contain a large number of embryos; so that
  when such a cocoon reached a foreign shore there would be a better chance of the species
  establishing itself there. I have referred elsewhere<a id="NtA_426"
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> to the singular habit of forming a temporary cyst which
  characterises one species of the genus <i>Aeolosoma</i>; this would perhaps tend to facilitate its
  transference in the way indicated from one spot to another.</p>

  <p>Earthworms, on the other hand, have not such easy means of travelling from country to country;
  the assistance which the cocoons in all probability give to the smaller aquatic Oligochaeta cannot
  be held to be of much importance in facilitating the migrations of the earthworms. In the first
  place, the animals themselves are of greater bulk, and their cocoons are naturally larger, and
  thus less easy of transportation. Secondly, they are deposited as a rule upon dry land, where the
  chances of their sticking to the feet of birds would be less; and thirdly, they are often
  deposited deep in the ground, which is a further bar to their being taken up. Another possible
  method by which earthworms could cross the sea is by the help of floating tree-trunks; it is,
  however, the case with many species that they are fatally injured by the contact of salt water.
  There are, it is true, a few species, such as <i>Pontodrilus</i> of the Mediterranean coast, which
  habitually live within reach of the waves; but with the majority any such passage across the sea
  seems to be impossible.<a id="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> On the other hand,
  rivers and lakes are not a barrier to the dispersal of the group. There are a few species, such as
  <i>Allurus tetragonurus</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page371"><span
  class="smaller">{371}</span></span>which live indifferently on land and in fresh water; and even
  some habitually terrestrial species can be kept in water for many weeks with impunity. A desert,
  on the other hand, is a complete barrier; the animals are absolutely dependent upon moisture, and
  though in dry weather the worms of tropical countries bury themselves deep in the soil, and even
  make temporary cysts by the aid of their mucous secretions, this would be of no avail except in
  countries where there were at least occasional spells of wet weather.</p>

  <p>The range of the existing genera and species is quite in keeping with the suggestions and facts
  already put forward. But in considering them we must first of all eliminate the direct influence
  of man. Every one who studies this group of animals knows perfectly well that importations of
  plants frequently contain accidentally-included earthworms; and there are other ways in which the
  transference of species from one country to another could be effected by man. There are various
  considerations which enable us to form a fair opinion as to the probability of a given species
  being really indigenous or imported. Oceanic islands afford one test. There are species of
  earthworms known from a good many, but with a few exceptions they are the same species as those
  which occur on the nearest mainland; in those cases where it is supposed that the animal
  inhabitants have reached an oceanic island by natural means of transit, it is a rule that the
  species are different, and even the genera are frequently different. That the bulk of them are the
  same seems to argue either frequent natural communication with the mainland or a great stability
  on the part of the species themselves. It is more probable that the identity is in this case to be
  ascribed to accidental transference.</p>

  <p>Another argument comes from the distribution of the family Lumbricidae. This family forms the
  bulk of the earthworms of the European and North American continents. But they are also found all
  over the world. With one or two exceptions, such as <i>Allolobophora moebii</i>, from Madeira, the
  extra-north-temperate species are identical with those found within that region. Now, if the
  migration had been by natural means there would surely in the lapse of time been some
  differentiation of species. Furthermore, Dr. Michaelsen has pointed out that in South America the
  presumably European forms (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Lumbricus</i> and <i>Allolobophora</i>) are found upon
  the coast and in cultivated ground; it is inland that <span class="pagenum" id="page372"><span
  class="smaller">{372}</span></span>the presumably indigenous species are met with. This again
  looks very like accidental transference.</p>

  <p>A mapping of the world in regions indicative of the distribution of earthworms produces a
  result which is slightly different from the accepted division. North America, Europe, and Northern
  Asia so far as is known agree in having as their distinctive earthworms the family Lumbricidae,
  which is very nearly the only one represented in these parts of the world. The majority of the
  species are common to the two continents; there cannot, in fact, be a separation of Nearctic and
  Palaearctic; we must accept the Holarctic region of Professor Newton. The Ethiopian region, on the
  other hand, is quite as it is in other groups, being bounded to the north by the desert of Sahara.
  The Neotropical region is quite distinct, and includes Central as well as South America, and the
  West Indian islands, even the Bermudas. It is, however, a question whether the more southern
  portions of the continent should not be cut off from the rest and joined with New Zealand, to form
  an Antarctic region. In these two countries, and also in Kerguelen and Marion Islands, the
  prevailing genera are <i>Acanthodrilus</i> and <i>Microscolex</i>. In America <i>Acanthodrilus</i>
  is found nowhere but in the more southern regions of the southern continent, as well as in the
  Falklands and South Georgia. New Zealand is characterised by other genera of Acanthodrilids
  besides <i>Acanthodrilus</i> itself; but the bulk of the species belong to the latter genus.
  <i>Acanthodrilus</i> also occurs (three species only) in Queensland and at the Cape of Good Hope.
  <i>Microscolex</i> is rather more widely dispersed, being found in other parts of America and in
  Europe, the island of Madeira (? accidentally imported); but it is undoubtedly chiefly
  concentrated in South America and in New Zealand. Apart from New Zealand, which, as already said,
  can only be doubtfully referred to the Australian region, the latter appears to form one with the
  Oriental region (to which, on account of its Perichaetidae, Japan should be added) of other
  writers. There is, so far as earthworms are concerned, no "Wallace's line" at all. The
  characteristic genera <i>Perichaeta</i> and <i>Megascolex</i> range from one extremity of the
  Indo-Australian region to the other. It is true that <i>Cryptodrilus</i> and <i>Megascolides</i>
  are limited to Australia itself (with the apparent exception of a species or two in America, for I
  can hardly separate <i>Argilophilus</i> of Eisen from <i>Megascolides</i>); <span class="pagenum"
  id="page373"><span class="smaller">{373}</span></span>but they are not at all well-defined genera,
  and indeed the generic distinctions of the whole family Cryptodrilidae are not in a satisfactory
  condition.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The Oligochaeta do not shade into the Polychaeta so imperceptibly
  as might be inferred from the current schemes of classification. Apart from minor points, which
  are not universally characteristic of the two groups, though never found except in one or the
  other, the Oligochaeta are to be defined by the complicated reproductive system; although in a few
  undoubted Polychaets there is a faint approach to this in the specialisation of some of the
  nephridia as sperm-receptacles and even as sperm-ducts. But nowhere among the Polychaeta are there
  the diversified sperm-ducts and oviducts, spermathecae and sperm-sacs, that are universal among
  the Oligochaeta. Moreover, no Polychaet has a clitellum, which is so distinctive of the
  Oligochaeta, and of their near allies the Leeches. Dr. Eisig has compared the glandular
  modification of the integument at the mouths of the sperm-ducts in the Capitellidae to the
  beginnings of a clitellum. This may be the case, but it is, in my opinion, more comparable to the
  similar glandular spots at the male pores in earthworms. The reproductive glands in the
  Oligochaeta (save for a few apparently abnormal cases) are restricted to at most two pairs of
  each, which occur in the same individual; the Polychaeta being dioecious. There is, in short, no
  form known which cannot be definitely referred to either the Polychaeta or the Oligochaeta,
  excepting perhaps <i>Ctenodrilus</i>, the anatomy of whose reproductive organs is at present
  unknown.</p>

  <p>It is a difficult task to classify the different families of the Oligochaeta; and to enter into
  the historical aspect of the matter would take too much space. I am myself disposed to divide them
  first of all into two main groups, for which I use Dr. Benham's<a id="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> names of Microdrili and Megadrili.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Microdrili</span> are, as a rule, small and aquatic in habit; they have
  short sperm-ducts which open on to the exterior in the segment which immediately follows that
  which contains the internal aperture; the clitellum is only one cell thick; the egg-sacs are
  large; the epoch of sexual maturity is at a fixed period. This group, to my thinking, includes the
  Moniligastridae; although Professor Bourne has denied my statement with regard <span
  class="pagenum" id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span>to the clitellum, and in
  this case it is not so easy to decide their systematic position.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Megadrili</span> are characterised by the precisely opposite characters.
  The sperm-ducts are longer; the clitellum is composed of many layers of cells; the egg-sacs are
  rudimentary; sexual maturity appears to be more or less continuous.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There is, however, a substantial agreement about the families which I here adopt,
  which may be fairly taken to express our present knowledge of the Order. For fuller details the
  reader is referred to my Monograph of the Order Oligochaeta.<a id="NtA_429"

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 1.</span> <i>Aphaneura.</i><a id="NtA_430"
  href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a>&mdash;This name was originally given to the present family by
  Vejdovsky; the family contains a single genus, <i>Aeolosoma</i>, of which there are some seven
  species. The name is taken from, perhaps, the most important though not the most salient
  characteristic of the worms. The central nervous system appears in all of them to be reduced to
  the cerebral ganglia, which, moreover, retain the embryonic connexion with the epidermis. The
  worms of the genus are fairly common in fresh waters of this country, and they have been also met
  with in North and South America, and in Egypt, India, America, and tropical Africa. They are all
  small, generally minute (1 to 2 mm. long), and have a transparent body variously ornamented by
  brightly-coloured oil globules secreted by the <span class="pagenum" id="page375"><span
  class="smaller">{375}</span></span>epidermis. These are reddish brown in <i>A. quaternarium</i>,
  bright green in <i>A. variegatum</i> and <i>A. headleyi</i>, in the latter even with a tinge of
  blue. In the largest species of the genus, <i>A. tenebrarum</i> they are olive green. In <i>A.
  niveum</i> the spots are colourless, and <i>A. variegatum</i> has colourless droplets mixed with
  the bright green ones. Fig. 195 shows very well the general appearance of the species of this
  genus. The body has less fixed outlines than in most worms, and the movement of the creatures is
  not unsuggestive of a Planarian. As the under side of the prostomium is ciliated, and as the
  movements of these cilia conduce towards the general movement of the body, the resemblance is
  intelligible. One species of <i>Aeolosoma</i>, at any rate, has a curious habit which is unique in
  the Order. At certain times, for some reason at present unknown, the worm secretes a chitinous
  capsule, inside which it moves about with considerable freedom; these capsules when first observed
  were mistaken for the cocoons of the worms; they are really homologous with the viscid secretion
  which the common earthworm throws off when in too dry soil, and with which it lines the chamber
  excavated in the earth in which it is lying. The worms of this genus multiply by fission; sexual
  reproduction has been but rarely observed.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Enchytraeidae.</i><a id="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a>&mdash;This family consists at present of rather over fifty
  well-characterised species, which are distributed into eleven genera. It is common in this country
  and in Europe generally; it has been met with in Spitzbergen and the extreme north; it occurs in
  the American continent from the north to the extreme south; it is also an inhabitant of New
  Zealand. The worms of this family are nearly always of small size, sometimes minute; they never
  exceed an inch or so in length, and that is a rare occurrence. They are equally at home in water
  and in soil, some species being common to the two media; a few are marine or littoral in habit,
  while others are parasitic in vegetable tissues. Like most earthworms, and unlike the majority of
  aquatic worms, the chaetae are without a bifid termination; the body-wall, too, is comparatively
  thick. The perivisceral fluid is often (as in certain Naids) loaded with elliptical or rounded
  corpuscles. Resemblances to earthworms rather than to the aquatic families of Oligochaeta are
  suggested by the long distance which separates the <span class="pagenum" id="page376"><span
  class="smaller">{376}</span></span>spermathecae from the male pores (segments 5 and 12), and by
  the paired or unpaired glands that have been already compared to the calciferous glands so
  universally present among earthworms. On the other hand, the male ducts are confined, as in the
  lower Oligochaeta, to two segments, upon one of which the internal, upon the other the external
  orifice is situated, and the oviduct is reduced to a simple pore, as in Naids; but this may be
  merely a matter of convergence by degeneration. Perhaps the most remarkable genus in the family is
  <i>Anachaeta</i>, which has no chaetae, but in their place a large cell projecting into the
  body-cavity, which appears to represent the formative cell of the chaeta. The integument of this
  genus contains true chlorophyll, according to Vejdovsky.</p>

  <p>A singular character, found, however, also in <i>Rhynchelmis</i> and <i>Sutroa</i> among the
  Lumbriculidae, is the opening of the spermathecae into the alimentary canal. This was originally
  discovered by Dr. Michaelsen, but has been abundantly confirmed.</p>

  <p><i>Stercutus</i> is a singular genus which was originally found in manure, and has the
  peculiarity that the alimentary canal is often aborted; this degeneration seems to bear some
  relation to the food and conditions of life.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 3.</span> <i>Discodrilidae.</i><a id="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a>&mdash;This family consists of small parasitic forms which were
  at one time assigned to the Hirudinea; there seems, however, to be no doubt that they are rightly
  included in the present Order. <i>Branchiobdella</i> is found upon the gills of the Crayfish,
  <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>; the American <i>Bdellodrilus</i> upon <i>Cambarus</i>. The chief
  reason for the former inclusion of these worms among the leeches was due to the absence of chaetae
  and to the presence of chitinous jaws and of suckers; apart from these structures there is nothing
  whatever leech-like about the worms. <i>Bdellodrilus</i> has two pairs of testes in segments 5 and
  6; there are two pairs of sperm-ducts, all opening, however, by a common "atrium" on the sixth
  segment; on the fifth open a pair of spermathecae, likewise by a common pore. The ovaries are in
  segment 7, and the ova escape by a pair of pores apparently like the single pore of the
  Enchytraeidae. The entire worm consists of only eleven segments.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 4.</span> <i>Phreoryctidae.</i><a id="NtA_433"
  href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a>&mdash;This family contains only two <span class="pagenum"
  id="page377"><span class="smaller">{377}</span></span>genera, <i>Phreoryctes</i> and
  <i>Pelodrilus</i>. The former is widely spread, occurring in Europe, North America, and New
  Zealand. <i>Pelodrilus</i> is limited to New Zealand. Most species of <i>Phreoryctes</i> are
  distinguished by their extraordinary length and thinness, and there is frequently a tendency to
  the disappearance of the chaetae. The most important anatomical fact about <i>Phreoryctes</i> (at
  any rate <i>P. smithii</i>) is that there are two pairs of ovaries as well as two pairs of testes,
  and that the ducts of all are simple and very much alike. This seems to argue the low position of
  the family in the series.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 5.</span> <i>Naidomorpha.</i><a id="NtA_434"
  href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a>&mdash;This family contains eight or nine genera, perhaps more;
  they are all of them aquatic and of small size, and they multiply by fission as well as sexually.
  The most noticeable peculiarity of the family is the "cephalisation" which occurs in the head
  segments. In some genera, in <i>Pristina</i> for example, there is no such cephalisation to be
  observed; but in others the dorsal bundles of chaetae commence a few segments farther back than
  the ventral, the segment where they commence being different and characteristic in the various
  genera. Thus in <i>Dero</i> the first four segments are without dorsal chaetae, and in <i>Nais</i>
  the first five are in this condition. There is thus a kind of "head" formed, whence the expression
  "cephalisation." <i>Dero</i>, <i>Nais</i>, and <i>Pristina</i> are commonly to be met with in
  ponds, lakes, etc., in this country. <i>Bohemilla</i> is rarer, and is to be distinguished by the
  remarkable serrated chaetae of the dorsal bundles. Of <i>Dero</i> and <i>Nais</i> there are a
  considerable number of different species; indeed it is usual perhaps to regard as distributable
  among three genera, <i>Nais</i>, <i>Stylaria</i>, and <i>Slavina</i>, the species which I am
  disposed to place in one genus, <i>Nais</i>. <i>Stylaria</i> is defined on this view by its
  extremely long prostomium, which has given rise to both its popular and technical names. "Die
  gezungelte Naide" was the term applied by one of its earliest investigators, and the name
  <i>Stylaria proboscidea</i> signifies the same peculiarity. But as the same inordinately long
  "proboscis" occurs in the South American <i>Pristina proboscidea</i>, belonging to a genus of
  which the other member does not possess so well developed a prostomium, it seems too variable a
  character upon which to differentiate a genus. <i>Chaetogaster</i> and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page378"><span class="smaller">{378}</span></span><i>Amphichaeta</i> have been placed by some
  systematists in a separate family. The first named contains four species which are fairly common.
  It is one of those worms in which the chaetae are not exactly related to the segmentation of other
  organs, which moreover sometimes show an independence in their segmentation; thus there are more
  nerve ganglia in the anterior segments of the body than there are septa.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 6.</span> <i>Tubificidae.</i>&mdash;The worms belonging to this family
  are of small size, and are all inhabitants of fresh or salt water, or the margins of pools and the
  sea. They differ from the last family in that asexual reproduction never occurs, and that the
  reproductive organs are situated rather farther back in the body. The male pores are upon segment
  11, and the oviduct-pores upon the following segment. This family differs from the Lumbriculidae
  in the fact that there are only a single pair of sperm-ducts.</p>

  <p>The earliest known Tubificid was the common <i>Tubifex rivulorum</i>, so widely dispersed in
  this country and elsewhere; but with it was at first confounded the somewhat similar genus
  <i>Limnodrilus</i>, which only differs in that the chaetae are all of the cleft variety, and never
  capilliform, as in <i>Tubifex</i>. The genera are mainly distinguished by the characters of the
  chaetae and of the male ducts. At the base of the series perhaps lies <i>Ilyodrilus</i>, which has
  many points in common with the Naids. The form of the terminal chamber into which the sperm-duct
  opens has the same simplicity as in that group, and the intestine is surrounded with a network of
  blood-vessels as in the Naids, a structure which is otherwise wanting in the Tubificidae. The
  development of the ova also is upon a plan which is met with in the Naids. The atrium (see p. <a
  href="#page361">361</a>) becomes more complicated in other Tubificidae. The extremity also is as a
  rule modified into a retractile penis. The discrete "prostate," of which we have already spoken,
  marks out a considerable number of genera, such as <i>Tubifex</i>, <i>Limnodrilus</i>,
  <i>Spirosperma</i>, <i>Hemitubifex</i>. In the marine <i>Clitellio</i> there is no such structure
  at all, and it is also wanting in the South American <i>Hesperodrilus</i>. In <i>Branchiura</i>
  there is a complete prostatic investment of the atrium, and in <i>Telmatodrilus</i> a large number
  of separate aggregations forming as many distinct prostates. <i>Vermiculus</i>, a genus consisting
  of but one species, found by Mr. Goodrich on the sea-shore in the neighbourhood of Plymouth, is
  remarkable for the unpaired character of the <span class="pagenum" id="page379"><span
  class="smaller">{379}</span></span>generative organs, a peculiarity which is shared by Stolc's
  genus <i>Bothrioneuron</i>. The gills upon the posterior segments of <i>Branchiura sowerbyi</i>
  and <i>Hesperodrilus branchiatus</i> have been already noticed above (p. <a
  href="#page352">352</a>). A very aberrant genus, perhaps not rightly referable to this family, is
  <i>Phreodrilus</i>,<a id="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> from New Zealand, first
  collected in water from a subterranean spring. It differs from all other Tubificids except
  <i>Hesperodrilus</i> in that the spermathecae lie behind the male pores, a state of affairs which
  is met with in the Lumbriculidae. Another singularity of structure concerns the sperm-duct, which
  is wrapped in a thin-walled sac, which has every appearance of being simply the outer muscular
  wall of the duct. Within this are the complicated coils of the duct, and also a quantity of free
  spermatozoa, whose mode of ingress is difficult to understand. Many of the Tubificidae live in
  tubes fabricated by themselves, whence the tail end protrudes. The integument in more than one
  species is vascular. This integumental blood system, universal among the earthworms, appears to be
  restricted to the present group among the Limicolae of Clapar&egrave;de.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 7.</span> <i>Lumbriculidae.</i><a id="NtA_436"
  href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a>&mdash;This family is not a large one, and is nearly limited in
  range to Europe and North America; indeed, if we omit the doubtful <i>Alluroides</i>, entirely to
  the Palaearctic region. There are only fourteen species, which are referred to eight genera. A
  number of dubious forms, as is the case with other families, may possibly ultimately swell this
  list. The type genus of the family, viz. <i>Lumbriculus</i>, upon which Bonnet made his
  experiments in section and subsequent regeneration, has only within the last year been thoroughly
  explored anatomically. But all the other genera are well known. The Lumbriculidae are of small or
  moderate size, and all of them aquatic in habitat. There are three characters which are nearly or
  quite universal in the genera of the family. In all of them the chaetae are only eight to each
  segment, arranged in couples, and are either cleft at the extremity or simple. As a rule which has
  but two exceptions, the genera <i>Alluroides</i> and <i>Lumbriculus</i>, there are two pairs of
  sperm-ducts, which, however, communicate with the exterior through a single terminal chamber on
  each side of the body.</p>

  <p>The dorsal blood-vessel has in the Lumbriculidae a series of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page380"><span class="smaller">{380}</span></span>contractile and blind appendages, which were
  at first mistaken for caeca of the intestine itself. There are two genera of this family in North
  America, which are not very different anatomically from their European representatives. The genera
  described by Eisen are <i>Sutroa</i><a id="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> and
  <i>Eclipidrilus</i>.<a id="NtA_438" href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> The latter lives in cold
  torrents at a great height in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada of California.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Fam. 8.</span> <i>Moniligastridae.</i>&mdash;This family,
  terrestrial in habit, is probably Oriental in range; but I have described a single species from
  the Bahamas which may possibly be referable to the category of accidentally introduced specimens.
  Our knowledge of this family is conveniently summed up in Professor Bourne's paper<a id="NtA_439"
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> upon the genus <i>Moniligaster</i>. There are some eighteen
  species, which range in size from an inch or so in length (<i>M. bahamensis</i>) to about two
  feet; this last measurement is that of the huge <i>M. grandis</i>, of which, together with many
  others, Professor Bourne gives coloured drawings. There is a second genus, <i>Desmogaster</i>,
  which is mainly characterised by the doubling of the reproductive organs. This was described by
  Rosa from Burmah. The family is noteworthy on account of the fact that every species belonging to
  it has at least four distinct gizzards, sometimes more; but as this multiplication of the gizzards
  has been also found in <i>Heliodrilus</i> among the Eudrilidae, and indeed elsewhere, it is
  insufficient to define the family. More characteristic is the fact that the sperm-ducts open on to
  the next segment to, or even the same segment as, that which contains their funnels; consequently
  the apertures of the oviducts are behind instead of in front of them. These pores are also
  situated in a very anterior position, the male pores being upon the tenth segment or between the
  tenth and eleventh, and the oviducal pores upon the following one. In these features the family
  presents resemblance to the aquatic Oligochaeta, from which, however, its stoutly-built gizzards,
  and vascular nephridia differentiate it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>II. Megadrili.</b></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 9.</span> <i>Perichaetidae.</i><a id="NtA_440"
  href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a>&mdash;The Perichaetidae comprise a larger <span
  class="pagenum" id="page381"><span class="smaller">{381}</span></span>number of species than any
  other family of earthworms; but it is a matter of considerable difficulty to divide the family
  satisfactorily into genera. The family as a whole may be defined as having numerous chaetae in
  most of the segments of the body.</p>

  <p>There is no other definition which will distinguish this family from the next two families, and
  even this definition is not absolutely distinctive. There are Acanthodrilids which have a large
  number of chaetae in each segment. The only difference is that in this case&mdash;in the genus
  <i>Plagiochaeta</i>&mdash;the chaetae are implanted in twos; this is not the case in the
  Perichaetidae. In all Perichaetidae that are known the sperm-ducts open in common with the ducts
  of the spermiducal glands; they generally open into them at some distance from the common external
  pore. In <i>Megascolex</i>, <i>Perichaeta</i>, and <i>Pleionogaster</i> the nephridia are of the
  diffuse type so widely spread among these worms, and the spermiducal glands are lobate.
  <i>Megascolex</i> differs from the others in the fact that in addition to the small scattered
  nephridia there are a pair of large nephridia in each segment, and the chaetae do not form
  absolutely continuous circles, but are interrupted above and below. <i>Pleionogaster</i> has more
  than one gizzard but otherwise agrees with <i>Perichaeta</i>; it is confined to the East.
  <i>Perichaeta</i> is tropical and occurs&mdash;no doubt introduced&mdash;in Europe and America.
  <i>Megascolex</i> is Old World only, and, like <i>Perichaeta</i>, Australian as well as Oriental.
  But whereas <i>Perichaeta</i> is rare in the Australian region, <i>Megascolex</i> is common there.
  <i>Perionyx</i> and <i>Diporochaeta</i> are the other genera which it is possible to recognise.
  Both of them have paired nephridia, and neither of them have intestinal caeca, a peculiarity which
  they both share with <i>Megascolex</i> and <i>Pleionogaster</i>. <i>Perionyx</i> principally
  differs from <i>Diporochaeta</i> in that the spermiducal glands are lobate, whereas in the latter
  they are as in the Acanthodrilidae. <i>Perionyx</i> is Oriental; <i>Diporochaeta</i> occurs in
  Australia and New Zealand.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A very distinctive feature of <i>Perichaeta</i>&mdash;perhaps only of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span>genus <i>sensu stricto</i>&mdash;is its
  exceeding activity. The first specimens ever noticed in this country, or at least of whose
  existence printed notice was taken, were exhibited by the late Dr. Baird of the British Museum, at
  a meeting of the Zoological Society. He remarked in that communication upon the agile fashion in
  which these tropical Annelids will spring off a table when touched or in any way interfered with.
  Numerous other observers have seen the same manifestations, and the name of "eel-worm" has been
  given to these <i>Perichaeta</i> by gardeners. It is worth putting on record here that in a
  species of <i>Acanthodrilus</i> (<i>A. capensis</i>) the same irritable behaviour is visible. When
  a <i>Perichaeta</i> moves it helps itself greatly by extending, or rather protruding, the buccal
  cavity, which serves as a sucker, and grips the ground in front until the rest of the body is
  brought forward. It is possibly on account of this extra facility for movement that the genus can
  climb trees with such ease. A species of <i>Perichaeta</i> has been recorded by Mr. Willey upon an
  epiphyte of a palm, and Dr. Benham has found that it is a new species, to which the name of
  <i>Perichaeta willeyi</i> has been given. The Lumbricid genus (if it be admitted as a genus),
  <i>Dendrobaena</i>, was so named on account of a similar habit of climbing trees. Very singular in
  its habit is the not inaptly-named <i>Perichaeta musica</i> of Java. It is a monster of its kind,
  several feet in length, and during the night makes "a sharp interrupted sound," apparently by the
  friction of the chaetae against stones. The species figured (p. <a href="#page381">381</a>) is, as
  are a few others, remarkable for the presence of twelve or seventeen spermathecae in segments 6
  and 7.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 10.</span> <i>Cryptodrilidae.</i><a id="NtA_441"
  href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a>&mdash;This family is one of the largest of the Oligochaeta;
  there are rather over 120 different species, which can be arranged in at least sixteen genera.
  They are found in most parts of the world, but abound principally in the tropics. Australia may be
  considered to be the headquarters of the family, which form its principal earthworm-inhabitants.
  Peculiar to this continent, or at least mainly confined to it, are the genera <i>Megascolides</i>,
  <i>Cryptodrilus</i>, <i>Fletcherodrilus</i>, <i>Trinephrus</i>, and <i>Digaster</i>.
  <i>Microscolex</i>, though occurring in many parts of the world, is characteristic of the more
  southern regions of South America and of New Zealand. Tropical Africa has the genera
  <i>Nannodrilus</i> and <i>Millsonia</i> limited to itself, and has besides nearly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page383"><span class="smaller">{383}</span></span>all the species of the genus
  <i>Gordiodrilus</i>. This family is one which it is exceedingly difficult to define and to split
  up into different genera. It shades almost imperceptibly into the Perichaetidae on the one hand,
  and is very hard to differentiate from the Acanthodrilidae on the other. A Cryptodrilid, like any
  member of the genus <i>Cryptodrilus</i>, with complete circles of chaetae would be a Perichaetid;
  and as there are species of <i>Perichaeta</i> in which the anterior segments have only a few
  chaetae in each segment, it is perhaps wrong to separate the two families at all. Apart from the
  chaetae, there is no peculiarity in the organisation of the family Perichaetidae that is not also
  met with in the Cryptodrilidae. Even the highly characteristic intestinal caeca so distinctive of
  the genus <i>Perichaeta</i> itself, as contrasted with <i>Megascolex</i> and the other genera,
  occur, though more numerously, in the African <i>Millsonia</i>, where there are forty or fifty
  pairs of them. A fairly common feature in the family is the presence of two, or even three, pairs
  of gizzards, a character which is also met with in the genus <i>Benhamia</i> among the
  Acanthodrilidae, and occurs also in some other families. The names <i>Digaster</i>,
  <i>Didymogaster</i>, <i>Perissogaster</i>, and <i>Dichogaster</i> have been founded upon this
  character. The excretory organs may be paired (in <i>Trinephrus</i> there are three pairs to each
  segment) or of the diffuse kind. The male pores are usually upon the eighteenth segment, but not
  unfrequently upon the seventeenth, and are often armed with long and ornamented chaetae.
  Spermiducal glands are invariably present, and may be lobate or tubular. There are two groups of
  small-sized genera, which in their simplicity of organisation stand at the base of the series; but
  it is very possible that the simplification is rather due to degeneration than to primitive
  position. One of these groups includes the semi-marine genus <i>Pontodrilus</i> (with which I
  include the phosphorescent <i>Photodrilus</i>) and <i>Microscolex</i>. In these forms the gizzard
  has disappeared, or is represented by a rudimentary structure, and the male pores are upon the
  seventeenth segment. In the other group are the genera <i>Ocnerodrilus</i>,<a id="NtA_442"
  href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> <i>Gordiodrilus</i>,<a id="NtA_443"
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> and <i>Nannodrilus</i>, which are of even smaller size, and
  have in the same way the male pores upon the seventeenth segment. The species of this group are
  often aquatic, and there is not only no gizzard <span class="pagenum" id="page384"><span
  class="smaller">{384}</span></span>(in most of the species), but the calciferous glands have been
  reduced to a single pair, which lie in the ninth segment. The latter character is also found in
  the Acanthodrilid <i>Kerria</i>, which has been associated with the above named.
  <i>Gordiodrilus</i> has the peculiarity that there are, as in Acanthodrilids, two pairs of tubular
  spermiducal glands.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 11.</span> <i>Acanthodrilidae.</i><a id="NtA_444"
  href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a>&mdash;This family is only with difficulty to be distinguished
  from the last. The following definition applies to all the members of the family with one
  exception, and does not apply to any Cryptodrilid with, so far as is known, one exception only.
  There are two pairs of spermiducal glands, opening upon the segments in front of and behind that
  which bears the apertures of the sperm-ducts.</p>

  <p>The one exception to this definition is the species <i>Acanthodrilus monocystis</i>, which I
  formerly placed in a distinct genus, <i>Neodrilus</i>. <i>Microscolex modestus</i> is the
  exception among the Cryptodrilidae; in that worm the male pores are upon the segment which follows
  that upon which the spermiducal glands open. The Acanthodrilidae show a considerable range of
  structural variation. This enables them to be separated into several well-marked genera. The type
  genus <i>Acanthodrilus</i> has a pair of nephridia in each segment. It contains thirty-five
  species, which are all from the southern hemisphere. These species show but little variation among
  themselves. <i>Benhamia</i> is a genus that differs from <i>Acanthodrilus</i> in the fact that the
  nephridia are of the complex type, so often met with in earthworms with many external pores. The
  segment that bears the male pores is entirely without any traces of the ventral chaetae. Here
  again there are a large number of species which are nearly confined to the continent of Africa.
  Dr. Michaelsen is indeed of opinion that the few species found in the East Indies and America are
  accidental importations. I have proposed to separate some of the New Zealand Acanthodrilids into a
  distinct genus, <i>Octochaetus</i>, which is somewhat intermediate between <i>Acanthodrilus</i>
  and <i>Benhamia</i>. They have multiple nephridia, but only a single gizzard. <i>Plagiochaeta</i>
  of Benham, from New Zealand, is in any case clearly a distinct form. It is mainly to be
  distinguished by the numerous chaetae in each segment. <i>Trigaster</i> Benham, is West Indian.
  <i>Deinodrilus</i> (New <span class="pagenum" id="page385"><span
  class="smaller">{385}</span></span>Zealand) has twelve chaetae in each segment.
  <i>Diplocardia</i>, from North America, has the male pores on segments 18, 19, 20.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 12.</span> <i>Eudrilidae.</i><a id="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a>&mdash;This is perhaps the most remarkable family of
  terrestrial Oligochaeta. Its distribution is no less curious than its structure. Up to the present
  it is not known outside tropical Africa, with the exception of the genus <i>Eudrilus</i> itself,
  which is almost world-wide in range. As, however, but one species of <i>Eudrilus</i> is found out
  of Africa, and as that species is so common in gatherings from various tropical countries, it
  seems to be an instance of a species with large capacities for accidental transference from
  country to country. The type genus, <i>Eudrilus</i>, has been known since 1871, when it was
  originally described by M. Perrier.<a id="NtA_446" href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> Since that
  date nineteen other genera have been described from Africa by Dr. Michaelsen, Dr. Rosa, and
  myself. The most salient external character of the group, not universal but general, is the
  unpaired male and female orifices. The orifices are commonly very conspicuous (see Fig. 197).</p>

  <p>The peculiarities of internal structure mainly concern the reproductive organs, the differences
  in which from genus to <span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span
  class="smaller">{386}</span></span>genus are often very great. We have already referred to the
  remarkable branching of the nephridial duct in the body-wall, and to the much modified calciferous
  glands of <i>Stuhlmannia</i> and some other genera. These structural variations perhaps permit the
  family to be divided into two sub-families. In one there are calciferous glands of the normal
  type, though peculiar in that one or more are median and ventral in position, and are unpaired;
  there is no branching of the nephridium in the body-wall; there are always, so far as is known,
  the Pacinian-corpuscle-like bodies in the integument. In the other sub-family the calciferous
  glands, if present (they are absent, for instance, in <i>Libyodrilus</i>), have undergone much
  modification in structure; the nephridia, where they have been investigated, have been found to
  branch copiously in the body-wall; the peculiar integumental bodies hardly ever occur.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 13.</span> <i>Geoscolicidae.</i><a id="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a>&mdash;This family is essentially tropical, being found in
  South America and the West Indies, in tropical Africa, in India, and in some of the islands of the
  Malay Archipelago. But it also occurs (<i>Sparganophilus</i> and <i>Criodrilus</i>) in Europe and
  in America. A good many of the genera are aquatic. This is the case with the two already
  mentioned; the genera <i>Glyphidrilus</i> and <i>Annadrilus</i> of the Malay Archipelago can live
  in water. The family is easily definable if we take the more typical forms; but at one end of the
  series it fades into the next family, that of the Lumbricidae. <i>Criodrilus</i> is one of the
  genera which is difficult to place. As is the case with many Geoscolicidae, <i>Criodrilus</i> has
  ornamented chaetae not only upon the clitellum, but upon the other segments of the body. This
  character was until recently unknown among the Lumbricidae; it has been lately found in
  <i>Allolobophora moebii</i> and <i>A. lonnbergi</i>. The absence of spermathecae characterises
  <i>Criodrilus</i> as well as other Geoscolicidae; but here again the character is not by any means
  distinctive, for in <i>Allolobophora constricta</i> there is the same absence of these organs. In
  <i>Criodrilus</i> the male pores are upon segment 15, as in the Lumbricidae, but a species of
  <i>Kynotus</i>, which is certainly a Geoscolecid, has these pores upon precisely the same segment.
  The only point in which <i>Criodrilus</i> is definitely a Geoscolecid, or rather not a Lumbricid,
  is in the forward position of the clitellum, which begins upon the fifteenth segment, far earlier
  than it does <span class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>in any
  undoubted Lumbricid. The peculiar elongated cocoon, which much resembles that of
  <i>Sparganophilus</i>, is another character which favours its Geoscolecine affinities. Dr.
  Michaelsen has proposed to unite <i>Criodrilus</i> and <i>Alma</i> into a family intermediate
  between the Geoscolicidae and the Lumbricidae.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 198.</span>&mdash;<i>Alma millsoni</i> F. E. B. &times; 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps the most remarkable genus in the whole family is <i>Alma</i>. One species lives in the
  Nile mud; another is the "Yoruba worm" of West Africa, whose habits have been described by Mr.
  Millson. The most marked character of this genus, apart from the branchiae (see p. <a
  href="#page352">352</a>) which apparently may be present or absent according to the species, is in
  the two enormous processes of the body-wall, which are illustrated in Fig. 198. These contain the
  sperm-ducts, which, however, open some way in front of the free end; they are provided on the
  ventral surface with a series of sucker-like structures and with peculiar chaetae. Another
  interesting genus is <i>Pontoscolex</i>, which was originally described from the sea-shore of
  Jamaica by Schmarda; there are only two species which are certainly characterised, though a
  variety from the Hawaian Islands may be a "good" species. It possesses the remarkable peculiarity
  that the chaetae at the end of the body are disposed in a perfectly irregular fashion, which
  earned for it the name of brush-tail at the hands of its discoverer, Fritz <span class="pagenum"
  id="page388"><span class="smaller">{388}</span></span>M&uuml;ller. This worm, which is universal, or
  nearly so, in its range, doubtless having been transferred accidentally from country to country,
  invariably shows a light spot not far from the tail; when this is examined with the microscope it
  is seen that the chaetae are here absent or very small, and that the muscular structure of the
  body-wall is slightly different; it was thought that this spot was a zone of growth where fresh
  segments could be added after the fashion of some of the aquatic Oligochaeta, to which, it may be
  remarked, the present genus shows a curious point of likeness in the bifid character of the
  chaetae. It seems, however, that there are really no grounds for the supposition, and it is
  possible that we have here a "weak" spot, such as that in the foot of certain land snails, which
  readily gives way when the worm is picked up by a bird, and allows the "better half" of the
  creature to escape. The Bermudian genus <i>Onychochaeta</i> offers a very strange peculiarity in
  that the chaetae on the hinder segments of the body are enormously larger than those in front, and
  end in strong hooks; it seems likely that their function is to maintain a tight hold of the ground
  while the worm is leaning out of its burrow, as every one has seen the common earthworms of this
  country do. <i>Onychochaeta</i> has the same irregular arrangement of the chaetae upon the greater
  part of the body, as has <i>Pontoscolex</i>. This family, like so many others, has its giants and
  its dwarfs. At one extreme is the great <i>Antaeus</i> of South America, several feet in length;
  at the other the inch-long <i>Ilyogenia</i> of Africa. The American <i>Urobenus</i> has a pair of
  intestinal caeca like those of <i>Perichaeta</i>, and placed in the same segment.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 14.9</span> <i>Lumbricidae.</i><a id="NtA_448"
  href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a>&mdash;This family is to be distinguished by the following
  assemblage of characters.</p>

  <p>The male pores are usually upon segment 15, and never behind that segment; the clitellum
  commences some way behind the male pores. The gizzard, which is invariably single, is equally
  invariably at the end of the oesophagus. There are three pairs of calciferous glands. The
  nephridia are always paired. The spermathecae never have a diverticulum.</p>

  <p>This family only contains three well-known genera, viz. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span><i>Lumbricus</i>, <i>Allolobophora</i>, and
  <i>Allurus</i>. The American <i>Bimastos</i> may be distinct. <i>Tetragonurus</i>, not allowed by
  some, is at present unknown except as regards external characters; it differs from the other
  Lumbricidae in the fact that the male pores are upon the twelfth segment. In <i>Allurus</i> they
  are upon segment 13, and in the remaining genera upon the fifteenth. <i>Lumbricus</i> is to be
  distinguished from <i>Allolobophora</i> by its prostomium, which is continued by grooves on to the
  buccal segment, so as to cut the latter in half. It has also median sperm reservoirs, as well as
  the paired sperm sacs which are alone present in <i>Allolobophora</i>.</p>

  <p>This is the only family of earthworms which, so far as is known, can brave the ice and snow,
  and what is still more <span class="pagenum" id="page390"><span
  class="smaller">{390}</span></span>difficult to understand, the perpetually frozen undersoil of
  the Arctic regions. Eisen has described a number of species from Spitzbergen, and Colonel Feilden
  recently sent me an example of <i>Allolobophora octoedra</i> from Kolguiev, where Mr.
  Trevor-Battye also saw another specimen. The family is characteristic of the Nearctic and
  Palaearctic regions, and though found beyond them, is probably elsewhere an accidental importation
  (see p. <a href="#page371">371</a>). There are at least fifteen species of this family found in
  England and Ireland, and probably more will be identified.</p>

  <p>There does not exist at present any comprehensive account of the British species of earthworms,
  though all of them are included in Dr. Rosa's recent revision of the family. Most of the British
  forms belong to the genus <i>Allolobophora</i>, which may be divided into two series according to
  whether the chaetae are quite close together or further apart. The extent of the clitellum and the
  position of those swollen eminences which appear earlier than the clitellum, and are known as
  tubercula pubertatis, offer further characters. In the following tables, extracted from those of
  Rosa, the known British species of this genus are grouped according to these three characters.
  With the help of these tables and Figs. 199 and 200, any of the species ought to be easily
  identified.</p>

  <p>There are of course other points by which the different species can be distinguished. Colour in
  a few cases enables a species to be named at once without any further aid. One of the most
  striking of these cases is the Brandling, so common upon dunghills, and so dear to some anglers.
  This worm is ringed with brownish purple upon a yellowish ground. The greenish <i>A.
  chlorotica</i> is often found under stones, and curls itself round into nearly a complete circle
  when disturbed. <i>A. cyanea</i>, of a bluish grey colour, is one of the earthworms very commonly
  met with in the early morning in London and the neighbourhood. More generally, however, the colour
  is of a paler or darker red, verging towards and attaining brown, or even blackish brown; and is
  so variable that nothing in the way of identification can be attempted from the colour alone, even
  with the most elaborate description.</p>

  <p><i>Lumbricus</i>, as already mentioned, is distinguished from all <i>Allolobophora</i> except
  <i>A. eiseni</i>, by the complete dovetailing of the prostomium into the first segment. There are
  five species in this country which may be thus distinguished by the position of the tubercula
  pubertatis. The most familiar species is the common <i>L. rubellus</i>.</p>

  <p>"The external appearance of the Hirudinea," remarks Professor Vaillant,<a id="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> "permits us, save for rare exceptions, to recognise at once
  the animals which belong to that group." The leeches are distinguished as a rule by the possession
  of two suckers, one at each end of the body; their general shape usually differs from that of
  other Annelids by its oval contour and its dorso-ventral flattening. <i>Cyclicobdella
  lumbricoides</i> of Grube, which Blanchard has stated to be the same species as <i>Nephelis
  tergestina</i>, has, however, almost the form of an earthworm by reason of its cylindrical shape
  and the inconspicuousness of the suckers, while <i>Lumbricobdella</i> also resembles an earthworm
  and has no posterior sucker at all.<a id="NtA_451" href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> The
  Oligochaet family Discodrilidae (see p. <a href="#page376">376</a>) agree with the leeches in
  their parasitism, in their general shape, in the presence of two suckers, and, furthermore, in the
  existence of jaws, which are found in no other Oligochaet, but occur in a large number of the
  Hirudinea. These facts, indeed, though not perhaps important by themselves, are indications of the
  really close resemblance of the Hirudinea to the Oligochaeta, a group which they approach not
  merely in such habits as the formation of a cocoon in which the eggs are enclosed, but also in
  many important points of internal and external structure. Indeed, the fundamental differences
  between the two groups are not numerous, and are not of such importance as has been given them by
  some writers.</p>

  <p>Leeches are to be found in most parts of the world, in <span class="pagenum" id="page393"><span
  class="smaller">{393}</span></span>situations which are sufficiently damp for their comfort. But
  we do not at present possess enough knowledge to state much as to the facts of their distribution.
  The structure of leeches is not so well known as is that of the earthworms; for they have not been
  to so great an extent collected in extra-European countries. It would even be desirable to
  ascertain precisely the species which inhabit these islands, the most recent enumeration (1865)
  being that contained in the British Museum Catalogue of non-parasitical worms by the late Dr.
  George Johnston. For Italy this has been lately done by Dr. Blanchard, and a good many of the
  species are common to the two countries. Johnston enumerates altogether (after subtracting what
  are probably synonyms) twenty-one species, distributed among the genera <i>Branchellion</i>,
  <i>Pontobdella</i>, <i>Piscicola</i>, <i>Nephelis</i>, <i>Trocheta</i>, <i>Haemopis</i>,
  <i>Hirudo</i>, and <i>Glossiphonia</i> (= <i>Clepsine</i>), which number will be possibly still
  further reduced. The first two genera are marine, the remainder being fresh water or terrestrial;
  <i>Trocheta</i> has been probably introduced.</p>

  <p>The use of <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i> is well known to many of us from personal experience. So
  extensively was this leech formerly made use of that it is now far from being a common species
  either in this country or in France. Those who desire full information as to Hirudiniculture
  should consult the work of Dr. Ebrard, published in 1857.<a id="NtA_452"
  href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> The former extensive use of the leech has led to the transfer
  of its name to the doctor who employs it, the authors of the sixteenth century constantly terming
  a physician a leech; it has been suggested, however, that the term was applied rather by way of
  analogy. The useful blood-sucking habits of the medicinal leech have been wrongly attributed to
  the innocent horseleech (<i>Aulastomum</i>)&mdash;innocent, that is to say, of the blood of
  Vertebrates, for it has been described as "a cruel and greedy worm," engulfing earthworms and even
  smaller specimens of its own species. <span class="pagenum" id="page394"><span
  class="smaller">{394}</span></span>"Horsleches," said an old writer, "are wholesome to drawe
  foorthe foule blood, if thei are put into a hollowe rede, and one of their endes cutte of, whereby
  the blood maie run forthe." But it is clearly not easy for a creature destitute of jaws and teeth
  to bite, and the similarity of general aspect has doubtless led to a confusion with the savagely

  <p>The Hirudinea are all distinctly segmented animals, but the segmentation differs from that of
  the Oligochaeta in two points. In the first place the number of segments is much smaller in a
  leech than in an Oligochaete, although the difference does not appear great at first sight.</p>

  <p>A leech's body may seem to be composed of seventy, eighty, or one hundred segments, a number
  quite as great as is found, for example, in the genus <i>Perichaeta</i> among the earthworms; but
  the apparent number of segments in the leech is produced by a very marked annulation of the real
  segments; and this is indeed the second point of difference referred to above. But there are
  earthworms which show frequently a secondary annulation,&mdash;secondary because it appears late
  and does not affect other organs <span class="pagenum" id="page395"><span
  class="smaller">{395}</span></span>of the body. A segment of an earthworm may indeed have five or
  six distinct annulations, but it will be bounded internally by two septa, and will bear only one
  set of chaetae externally. In the leech external clues to the definition of a segment were until
  recently wanting. They appear now to have been found in the sensory organs of the skin (Figs. 201
  and 202), which are, according to Whitman,<a id="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a>
  disposed in a perfectly metameric fashion. Judged by this, and also by the nephridia and
  nerve-ganglia, the number of segments in a leech does not appear to exceed twenty-six,
  independently of the sucker, which may represent a few fused segments, seven (in the medicinal
  leech) according to Leuckart.</p>

  <p>The eyes, which are so useful in the systematic arrangement of the group, appear to have been
  evolved from these sensory organs by a further exaggeration of their peculiarities. Figs. 202 and
  203 show this point convincingly. The segmental sense organ is shown in Fig. 202; to the outside
  of certain sense cells, below which are a mass of ganglion cells, are certain peculiar transparent
  cells very similar to the clear cells found in the interior of the eye (Fig. 203). The segmental
  disposal of the sensory bodies and of the eyes is shown in Fig. 201.</p>

      the "R&egrave;gne Animal.") &times;1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some Hirudinea are furnished with external branchiae; this is the case with
  <i>Branchellion</i>, in which genus the branchiae (Fig. 204) have an arborescent form; in
  <i>Cystibranchus</i> there are a series of paired simple vesicles which take the place of these
  more complicated respiratory organs of <i>Branchellion</i>. The Hirudinea do not, save for one
  exception (<i>Acanthobdella</i>), possess chaetae; but it must be borne in mind that the
  Discodrilidae and the genus <i>Anachaeta</i> among the Oligochaeta are in the same condition. In
  <i>Acanthobdella</i><a id="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> there are two pairs of
  chaetae upon each side of the anterior five segments of the body. According to the figure which
  Grube, the <span class="pagenum" id="page396"><span class="smaller">{396}</span></span>original
  describer of the genus, gives of these chaetae, the part implanted in the body is straight, while
  the part extending freely beyond the body is sharply hooked.</p>

  <p>The body of the leeches is never ciliated externally; there is, as in the higher Oligochaeta, a
  cuticle secreted by the underlying epidermis. The Hirudinea have, like the Oligochaeta, a
  clitellum which, as in some of the lower members of that group, is limited to a very few segments
  in the immediate neighbourhood of the generative openings. It occupies in <i>Hirudo</i> segments
  9, 10, and 11. The epidermis gives rise to many unicellular glands which either remain <i>in
  situ</i> or get moved to a deeper position. In this the leeches exactly resemble the earthworms.
  There is generally a great deal of connective tissue in the body-wall. The muscles consist of
  circular, longitudinal, and radial series. The individual fibres have the same structure as those
  of the Oligochaeta, consisting of a soft and undifferentiated core, round which is a
  radially-striated sheath of contractile substance.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The leeches are divided into the Rhynchobdellae, which have a
  proboscis but no jaws, and the Gnathobdellae, which possess a series of jaws but have no
  proboscis. But the division is not a hard and fast one, for we have Whitman's genus
  <i>Leptostoma</i>, which should belong to the jawed division, but which has quite rudimentary jaws
  without the sharp denticles so characteristic of <i>Hirudo</i>. The pharynx is furnished with
  salivary glands. The oesophagus is followed by the proventriculus, which has a varying number of
  pairs of caeca; then comes the intestine and the rectum. The anus is, as a general rule, placed
  dorsally to the sucker, but there are a few rare exceptions where the anus is within the sucker.
  The caeca are totally absent in <i>Trocheta</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Vascular System.</b>&mdash;As will be seen from Fig. 205, the vascular system of the
  Hirudinea is constructed on a plan which closely resembles that of the Oligochaeta. The diagram
  represents <i>Glossiphonia</i>, one of the Rhynchobdellae, the group which comes nearer to the
  Oligochaeta in many particulars than the Gnathobdellae. We can recognise a dorsal and a ventral
  vessel, which are united in the anterior part of the body by three perioesophageal rings, the
  elongation of which, particularly of the last pair (<i>v</i>), from before backwards is very
  marked. In the region of the sucker the dorsal and ventral vessels are united by fourteen shorter
  loops, the number of which has an interesting <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span
  class="smaller">{397}</span></span>relation to the number of segments out of which this portion of
  the body is possibly formed. It will be observed also that the dorsal vessel is double in this
  region, a condition which obtains along its whole length in <i>Branchellion</i>&mdash;a repetition
  of what has been described in more than one species of Oligochaete. In the region of the last pair
  of digestive caeca the dorsal vessel has appended to it copious sinuses which embrace the
  intestine and supply its walls with blood. In <i>Hirudo</i> there are only a pair of lateral
  vessels, and neither dorsal nor ventral vessels; in this leech and in the Gnathobdellae generally
  there are intra-epidermic capillaries, a fact first discovered by Professor Lankester, and now
  known to occur also in the Oligochaeta.</p>

  <p>The development of the blood-vessels shows that they have no relation whatever to the coelom,
  in spite of their subsequent connexion with it. The two longitudinal stems of <i>Hirudo</i> arise
  as cavities in the somatic layer of the mesoblast after the formation of the coelom. In
  <i>Nephelis</i>, but not in <i>Hirudo</i>, Dr. B&uuml;rger thinks that there is some reason for
  regarding the vascular system as the remains of the primitive segmentation-cavity of the embryo,
  an opinion which is held in respect of the vascular system of many other animals.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Body-Cavity.</b>&mdash;One of the most marked differences between the leeches and the
  Oligochaeta is in the body-cavity. In the latter there are a series of cavities corresponding to
  the segments, which are bounded in front and behind by the intersegmental septa, and in which all
  the viscera lie. In leeches such an arrangement is not recognisable save in <i>Acanthobdella</i>,
  where Kowalevsky<a id="NtA_455" href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> has quite recently described a
  typical coelom divided by septa into twenty segments. In transverse sections the body of other
  leeches appears at first sight to be solid, owing to the growth of the muscles and connective
  tissue. A more careful study, however, has revealed the <span class="pagenum" id="page398"><span
  class="smaller">{398}</span></span>fact that there are considerable remains of the body-cavity or
  coelom which form a complicated system of spaces and channels. What has happened, in fact, in the
  leech is that the coelom has become gradually and partially obliterated by proliferation of the
  cells in the interior of the body, a process of obliteration which has already commenced in the
  Oligochaeta. In many of the latter, some of the principal blood-vessels have become surrounded by
  a space cut off from the general body-cavity, while in the majority a special cavity surrounds the
  testes and the funnels of the sperm-ducts. This process of the formation of separate cavities for
  the inclusion of the several viscera culminates in the leeches with the marked obliteration of the
  greater part of the coelom. This has become so much reduced to the condition of narrow tubes that
  there has been a tendency to confuse it with the vascular system, more especially perhaps in those
  forms in which the blood is tinged with haemoglobin, and in which there is a connexion between the
  two systems of spaces. This confusion has been further increased by the plan of injecting the
  vascular system, a method of investigation which must be employed with great care in
  delicately-organised creatures whose tissues can be easily ruptured, and so lead to a flow of the
  injecting fluid into places and in directions impossible during life.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In transverse sections of leeches it may be seen in successful preparations that the various
  organs of the body are enclosed in spaces. The funnels of the nephridia open into lacunae which
  could hardly in any case be regarded as blood spaces, while the blood-vessels themselves with
  their muscular walls cannot be confounded, at least in the case of the larger trunks, with the
  spaces not having muscular walls which surround them. Furthermore, it will be pointed out
  immediately that the reproductive organs are produced on the walls of spaces which are the
  commencement in the embryo of the reduced coelom of the adult worm. These spaces therefore conform
  in every particular to the general <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>conditions which have been laid down about the characters of a
  true coelom. As to the complexity of this system, attention may be directed, to the accompanying
  diagram (Fig. 206) of the coelom of a segment of <i>Glossiphonia</i>, which has been lately worked
  out in detail.<a id="NtA_456" href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> It will be observed that there
  are four main longitudinal sinuses which are connected by a complicated system of transverse tubes
  and spaces. In the anterior part of the body, before the point where the intestinal caeca arise,
  the dorsal and ventral lacunae fuse to form one larger so-called median lacuna. The cavity of this
  is interrupted, in correspondence with the segmentation of the body, by septa exactly comparable
  to those of Oligochaeta; but the septa in <i>Glossiphonia</i> are not present at every segment. So
  far our account of the coelom is chiefly derived from the genus <i>Glossiphonia</i>. In
  <i>Hirudo</i>, which is an example of the Gnathobdellae, the coelom is still further reduced; the
  lateral sinuses in them appear to be absent. But on the other hand there is formed a series of
  cavities in a form of connective tissue which has been termed botryoidal tissue. The cells of this
  tissue become hollowed out, and form channels which are in communication on the one hand with the
  remains of the coelom and on the other with the vascular system. This system has certain analogies
  with the lymphatic vessels of Vertebrates, and, like them, is an intermediary between the
  body-cavity and the blood. Originally, however, these botryoidal vessels have nothing whatever to
  do with either the vascular or the coelomic system; their connexion with both is a purely
  secondary affair, and only appears, comparatively speaking, late in life.</p>

  <p>The development of the spaces here spoken of collectively as coelom confirms this
  interpretation of their nature. In the embryos of <i>Hirudo</i>, <i>Aulastomum</i>, and
  <i>Nephelis</i> there is a ventral space,<a id="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> which
  includes the nerve-cord. Into this open a series of paired and segmentally-disposed lateral
  cavities, a pair to each segment. The ventral cavity itself is formed by fusion of the median
  parts of the lateral cavities. There is here clear evidence of a coelom, developed on a plan
  fundamentally identical with that of the Oligochaeta in that it is formed as a paired series of
  chambers corresponding to the segmentation of the body.</p>

  <p><b>Nephridia.</b>&mdash;The "segmental organs" or nephridia are seen in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page400"><span class="smaller">{400}</span></span>their simplest form in such a type as
  <i>Glossiphonia</i>&mdash;the Rhynchobdellae, to which this genus belongs, being indeed in most
  particulars less specialised than the Gnathobdellae. Here we have a distinct funnel opening freely
  into the median or ventral coelomic space, which is immediately followed by a rounded swelling
  termed by Oka<a id="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> the capsule; this is filled with
  cells, in the interstices of which the ductules are situated and meander. There is in this capsule
  a very strong likeness to the glandular brownish swelling which immediately follows the funnel in
  the nephridia of certain of the aquatic Oligochaeta, for example the Naids, where, as Vejdovsky
  has shown, there is a similar "rete mirabile" of the nephridial duct. After the capsule is a
  single row of cells which are disposed in a complicated coil. These cells are perforated by the
  duct, which is thus, as in the Oligochaeta, intracellular. In the first set of cells the duct is
  single, and gives off numerous branchlets into the interior of each cell, a condition which has
  also been observed in many Oligochaeta. Afterwards the cells are perforated by two, or even three,
  main ducts, for the duct returns upon itself and traverses the row of cells more than once; there
  are also branchlets developed from one or other of the main ducts. The terminal part of the
  nephridium is a short invagination from the exterior, which is lined by cells. There is clearly a
  close resemblance here with the nephridium of an Oligochaete. The nephridium, however, except for
  the funnel and the narrow tube immediately following it, does not appear to be ciliated.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is, however, some difference of opinion as to the portions of the nephridium where there
  are two ducts in a single cell. Bourne<a id="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> thinks
  that where there are two ducts there are two <span class="pagenum" id="page401"><span
  class="smaller">{401}</span></span>cells, one lying inside the other, and that there is sometimes
  also a telescoping of cell within cell where the duct is single. In <i>Hirudo</i> the same writer
  has described the nephridial funnel, which has lost the simple character of that of
  <i>Glossiphonia</i>. The funnel is represented by a cabbage-head-like mass (Fig. 207, <i>f</i>) of
  ciliated cells with no single definite outlet to the exterior as in <i>Glossiphonia</i>. It
  appears to be an organ which has lost its proper function&mdash;a degeneration of the funnel
  being, as a matter of fact, not unknown in the Oligochaeta, where it may be carried to absolute
  extinction (<i>Chaetogaster</i>). In <i>Branchellion</i> and <i>Pontobdella</i> the simple
  metameric arrangement of the nephridia is to some extent lost, owing to the formation of a network
  continuous from segment to segment. It will be borne in mind that the Oligochaeta are the only
  other Chaetopods in which such a nephridial network has been stated to exist.</p>

  <p><b>Male Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;In <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i> there are nine,
  occasionally ten, pairs of testes, which are round white bodies arranged segmentally, <i>i.e.</i>
  a pair to each segment. From each arises a slender, somewhat sinuous tube, which enters the common
  collecting tube of its own side; each of these is much contorted at the upper end, the coiled
  portion being termed the epididymis. From this they enter a muscular penis which can be protruded.
  This is the arrangement met with in all leeches, save for the fact that the penis is absent in
  some; in <i>Glossiphonia</i> (see Fig. 208) this is the case. The number of pairs of testes also
  varies; and in <i>Nephelis</i> they are no longer arranged metamerically.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The testes arise as local proliferations of the epithelium of the lateral coelomic cavities,
  but from the somatic wall, not from the splanchnic, as in the case of the ovaries to be described
  later. A portion of the tissue which is to form the testis grows out laterally into a thin cord,
  which is to become the vas efferens of that <span class="pagenum" id="page402"><span
  class="smaller">{402}</span></span>testis. Later both testis and duct become hollowed out with a
  common cavity. The main portion of the vas deferens of each side, as well as the terminal
  copulatory apparatus, is an ingrowth from the epidermis which meets the downgrowths from the
  testes.</p>

  <p>That there are considerable differences between the reproductive organs of the leeches and
  those of Oligochaeta will be apparent from the above description. There are, however, to begin
  with, certain obvious similarities. In the first place, the origin of the reproductive glands is
  identical; in both groups also the efferent ducts consist of two portions&mdash;an invagination
  from the outside, and a formation of the proximal part of the ducts near to the glands. In
  <i>Moniligaster</i>, where&mdash;exceptionally&mdash;the testes develop on the posterior wall of
  their segment in close contact with the funnels of the sperm-ducts, there is no very hard and fast
  line to be observed between the tissues of the two. The hollowing out of the testis in the leech,
  and the continuity of the cavity thus formed with the duct, is a specialty of the leeches not
  found among the Oligochaeta.</p>

  <p>Like many Oligochaeta, the leeches may form spermatophores in which the sperm is packed for its
  conveyance from one individual to another. <i>Glossiphonia</i> (<i>Clepsine</i>) <i>plana</i>,
  where the structure in question has been elaborately described by Whitman,<a id="NtA_460"
  href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> may be selected as an example. The spermatophore (Fig. 209) is
  about 8 mm. long, and is clearly formed of two halves, each of which is formed separately in one
  ductus ejaculatorius, the soldering together being effected in the common part of the male ducts,
  where also a basal portion with a single lumen is added. The spermatophore has a double wall. It
  is deposited not in the neighbourhood of the generative pores, but upon the back; and Whitman has
  discovered the extraordinary fact that the spermatozoa find their way through the body-wall of the
  leech into the interior of its body, where fertilisation presumably occurs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span class="smaller">{403}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Female Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;The ovaries of the Hirudinea appear to differ from
  those of the Oligochaeta in that the ovaries are continuous with their ducts. In <i>Hirudo</i>,
  however, the real ovary of each side consists of masses of germinal tissue lying freely within a
  sac which communicates with a duct; the two ducts unite to form a much convoluted tube which opens
  into a thick-walled vagina, itself opening again on to the exterior by a median unpaired opening
  on the seventh segment. The muscular vagina is not always present.</p>

  <p>The median unpaired female aperture offers now no particular difficulty, since in many
  earthworms, e.g. <i>Perichaeta</i>, this orifice is in the same condition; nor does the fusion of
  the oviducts and the so-called ovaries; for in <i>Eudrilus</i>, for example, and in many
  Eudrilidae, the ovary is contained in a sac into which the oviduct also opens. It will be noticed
  too that the existence of short oviducts as compared with the long sperm-ducts is a further point
  of likeness to at any rate the higher Oligochaeta. But a further comparison needs first to be
  based upon a consideration of the development of the different sections of the apparatus in the
  leech. The independence of the ovaries and their ducts has been proved by several observers; quite
  recently B&uuml;rger has dealt with the matter in <i>Nephelis</i>, <i>Hirudo</i>, and <i>Aulastomum
  gulo</i>.<a id="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> He has found that the ovaries arise
  from the splanchnic wall of the lateral coelomic cavities; they are therefore proliferations of
  the coelomic epithelium, as in Oligochaeta and all Coelomates so far as is known. The peripheral
  layer of the mass of indifferent cells which constitutes the ovary becomes somewhat modified; its
  cells are flattened, and it at length separates itself and forms a capsule surrounding the other
  cells, which are in fact, or become, the ovary. This capsule meets and fuses with the ducts, which
  are invaginations from the exterior of the body.</p>

  <p>There are clearly differences between the ovary of a leech and that of a typical Oligochaete
  like <i>Lumbricus</i>. The only point of agreement, in fact, is the origin of the reproductive
  gland itself from the walls of the body-cavity. In <i>Lumbricus</i> and allied forms, whatever may
  be held with regard to their homologies, the oviducts as a matter of fact appear first as funnels,
  which afterwards bore their way to the exterior. They are <span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span
  class="smaller">{404}</span></span>purely mesoblastic structures, not&mdash;except perhaps the
  very extremity&mdash;derived from an ingrowth from the epidermis. We have, however, other
  Oligochaeta in which there are closer resemblances to what has just been described in the
  Hirudinea. In more than one point the aberrant family of the Eudrilidae come nearer to the
  Hirudinea than any other Oligochaeta, in spite of <i>Branchiobdella</i> with its jaws and sucker.
  Now in <i>Eudrilus</i> the ovary is enclosed in a capsule which becomes continuous with the duct
  of the great sperm-holding pouch, itself an invagination from the exterior; there is no reason in
  this Annelid why the ova should not reach the exterior by this system of ducts, although there is
  no actual experimental proof that they do so. In any case there is also an oviduct corresponding
  to that of <i>Lumbricus</i>, which opens into the opposite side of the duct of the spermathecal
  pouch on the one hand, and into the receptaculum ovorum on the other; it has no direct connexion
  whatever with the sac containing the ovary. If we were to cut off the receptaculum and the oviduct
  and reduce the spermathecal sac to its duct, the result would be much the same as we find it in
  the leech.</p>

  <p><b>Cocoon.</b>&mdash;The practice of forming a cocoon for the shelter of the eggs and of the
  developing young is shared with the Oligochaeta; but not all leeches deposit their eggs in this
  manner. <i>Glossiphonia</i>, for instance, carries its eggs upon the ventral face of the body,
  where the young remain for some time after they are hatched attached by the posterior sucker to
  their parent's body, and from which situation of safety they make short excursions. Other leeches
  deposit their eggs singly, but agglutinated together upon stones, etc. In the medicinal leech the
  cocoon is ovoid in shape, and from the end, which is closed by a temporary plug, the young when
  ready escape. This cocoon is deposited, as is that of an earthworm, in soil near to the borders of
  a marsh or pond, so that the young, while enjoying the requisite degree of moisture, may not be
  injured by a too wet environment. On the other hand <i>Pontobdella</i> and some other leeches lay
  their cocoons attached to bodies actually submerged in the water. The cocoon is secreted, as in
  Oligochaeta, by the clitellum, and as in them, is drawn off over the head, the ova and sperm
  probably flowing into it during the process. The elasticity of the slightly hardened mucus causes
  the two ends of the cocoon to <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span
  class="smaller">{405}</span></span>close up when it is free from the body; it is then whitish and
  soft, and the leech fixes it, and appears to polish the surface with its buccal sucker. In a few
  hours the cocoon becomes amber brown, a colour which characterises the cocoons of a great many
  earthworms and other Oligochaeta. The medicinal leech forms its cocoon in the same way as does
  <i>Nephelis</i>, to which the above description refers; but when the cocoon is formed the leech
  covers it with another layer of mucus, which Vaillant, from whose work the foregoing notes are
  extracted,<a id="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> thinks may be produced from the
  so-called salivary glands.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The number of different kinds of leeches is at present uncertain.
  Seeing that no less than sixty-four varieties of the common <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>&mdash;colour
  varieties, it is true&mdash;are said to exist, it is not wonderful that the labours of some
  systematists have been severe, and have provoked much criticism and alteration on the part of
  others.<a id="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> As to genera, Vaillant, in his recent
  continuation of de Quatrefages' "Annel&eacute;s" in the <i>Suites &agrave; Buffon</i>, which includes the
  literature up to the year 1886, allows thirty-seven, some (three) of which, however, are admitted
  to be <i>incertae sedis</i>. Blanchard, who has paid a great deal of attention to the group,
  reduces these by six, which he considers to be synonyms; but on the other hand he has added or
  rescued from oblivion six or seven others, and Whitman has instituted several Japanese and
  Australian genera. Most of these generic types are, however, only imperfectly known, and from
  external characters only. It is quite problematical how many valid genera should be retained; in
  the meantime those that are fairly well known are divided by Blanchard<a id="NtA_464"
  href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> in the following way<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Rhynchobdellae.</b>&mdash;Hirudinea with an exsertile proboscis, without jaws,
  and with colourless blood.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page406"><span class="smaller">{406}</span></span></div>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 1.</span> <i>Ichthyobdellidae.</i>&mdash;Body formed of two regions, a
  narrower anterior portion and a wider "abdomen," both anterior and posterior suckers distinct from
  the body.</p>

  <p>These leeches are parasites of fishes and of some other animals such as tortoises. The family
  contains a number of genera. <i>Branchellion</i> (Fig. 204) has a series of leaf-like branchiae on
  both sides; in <i>Cystibranchus</i> the respiratory organs are reduced to a series of round
  vesicles. The latter genus occurs in Europe and North America, and is parasitic upon marine and
  fresh-water fishes. <i>Piscicola</i> is a common leech which confines its attacks to the
  inhabitants of fresh water. <i>Pontobdella</i> (Fig. 210) is marine, and affects rays and sharks;
  the best known species, <i>P. muricata</i>, is usually of a green colour.</p>

  <p>To the family Ichthyobdellidae also belongs the large Chilian leech <i>Macrobdella
  valdiviana</i>, of which there is or are also species in North America. Philippi's figure of this
  leech<a id="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> shows the distinct neck; and as it has no
  jaws, it should be referred to the present family. It has got an undue reputation for size, 2&frac12;
  feet<a id="NtA_466" href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> having been assigned to it. As a matter of
  fact Philippi's illustration depicts an Annelid of about 7 inches in length, with a greatest
  diameter of about an inch. But doubtless when extended in walking it would be longer&mdash;1&frac12;
  feet, Philippi thinks. It has no eyes, a failing which is not unusual among the leeches.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Glossiphoniidae.</i>&mdash;Anterior sucker fused with the
  body, posterior sucker distinct. No cocoon.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig210.jpg"><img style="width:11%" src="images/fig210.jpg" alt="fig210"

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 210.</span>&mdash;<i>Pontobdella muricata.</i> &times; 1.
      (After Bourne.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The members of this family all inhabit fresh water; they have the habit of depositing the eggs
  separately, which are then fixed to the ventral surface of the body, and the young when hatched
  are <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span class="smaller">{407}</span></span>still protected by
  the parent, returning to its body for shelter. The type genus <i>Glossiphonia</i> ( =
  <i>Clepsine</i>) is common in Europe, and has many species. The Mexican and Amazonian
  <i>Haementeria</i> contains a number of species, of which the Mexican <i>H. officinalis</i> is
  used in medicine; but according to Miguel Jimenez, its use is apt to be attended with unpleasant
  symptoms. Drowsiness, a buzzing in the ears, and the development of a painful rash are some of the
  effects produced by its bite. It is disputed whether the animal's saliva or foreign matter
  introduced by it into the wound are the cause of the symptoms.</p>

  <p><i>Mesobdella</i> of Blanchard<a id="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> is said to be
  intermediate between this family and the next. Each segment has three annuli, as in this family,
  but the leech has three jaws, as in <i>Hirudo</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Gnathobdellae.</b>&mdash;Hirudinea without a proboscis, generally with jaws;
  the blood is red; the eggs are invariably deposited in cocoons.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 1.</span> <i>Gnathobdellidae.</i>&mdash;Pharynx with three denticulate
  jaws.</p>

  <p>This family as well as the next is terrestrial or fresh-water in habit. It contains a number of
  generic types, including the medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>, and the horseleech,
  <i>Haemopis</i> (<i>Aulastomum</i>) <i>gulo</i>. The former can be distinguished from the latter
  by its power of contracting itself into an oval olive-shaped form, which power is not possessed by
  the horseleech; the latter has, moreover, only two caeca, while the common leech has ten pairs of
  these appendages of the intestine. The genus <i>Limnatis</i> is called after the Greek word <span
  title="limn&ecirc;tis" class="fsn">&lambda;&iota;&mu;&nu;&#x1FC6;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, which
  Theocritus applied to the leech. It is found in the Nile, and caused serious inconvenience to the
  army of Napoleon. His soldiers in drinking at pools sucked up the small leeches not thicker than a
  horse's hair, whose presence in the hinder part of the mouth cavity produced divers objectionable
  results, such as spitting of blood and hindered respiration.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fam. 2.</span> <i>Herpobdellidae.</i>&mdash;Pharynx without denticulate jaws,
  with three unarmed chitinous plates.</p>

  <p>A characteristic genus of this family is <i>Trocheta</i>, which is so common at the Zoological
  Society's Gardens and in the Regent's Park, and which has been met with in other places near
  London; it is in this country an introduced species, but is found in many <span class="pagenum"
  id="page408"><span class="smaller">{408}</span></span>parts of the continent. It is a land-leech,
  and lives upon earthworms.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Haemadipsa</i>, which M. Blanchard places in a special sub-family, contains a
  number of species which are for the most part land-leeches. Land-leeches occur in many parts of
  the world, but chiefly in the tropics&mdash;in India, Ceylon, Java, South America, etc. They lie
  in wait for their prey, upon the ground as a rule; but they may ascend herbs and shrubs to gain a
  better outlook when they are aware of an approaching footstep. A vivid account of the ferocity of
  these tiny Annelids in Ceylon can be read in Sir J. E. Tennent's <i>Natural History of Ceylon</i>.
  They have been said to be so pugnacious and so poisonous that persons surprised in their sleep by
  the pests have succumbed to their united efforts. A whole battalion of English soldiers decamped
  on one occasion from a wood which was overflowing with land-leeches. The familiar misquotation
  "lethalis hirudo" might well be applied to this species. Professor Whitman has written much upon
  the habits of the land-leech of Japan (<i>Haemadipsa japonica</i>), which bites so softly that its
  presence cannot be detected except for the stream of blood which trickles from the wound. While it
  is feeding it emits from the pores of the nephridia a clear fluid, which, as it appears, is used
  to keep the skin moist; when unduly dried the same phenomenon occurs. It is curious that in this
  and other leeches the nephridia should play a part which in the earthworm is played by the dorsal
  pores; in both animals the glands of the skin are also concerned with the same duty.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The purely aquatic leeches swim by undulations, and also crawl by the help of the
  two suckers, like a "Geometer" caterpillar. But when a land-leech is dropped into the water it at
  once sinks to the bottom and crawls out; it does not swim, but can survive immersion for a long
  period. In this it resembles the earthworms, which can also survive a prolonged immersion, and
  even in the case of some are indifferent to the medium, land or water, in which they live; the
  land-leech, however, is entirely dependent upon damp surroundings; a dry air is fatal to it. The
  land-leech of Japan leaves a slimy trail behind it as it crawls, in this respect recalling the
  land Planarian <i>Bipalium kewense</i>.</p>

  OF THE GROUP.</span></p>

  <p>The animals included in the above-named group were formerly associated with the Echinodermata.
  Delle Chiaje<a id="NtA_468" href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> states that Bohadsch of Prague in
  1757 was the first to give an accurate description of <i>Sipunculus</i> under the name of
  <i>Syrinx</i>, but Linnaeus, who noted that in captivity the animal always kept its anus directed
  upwards, re-named it <i>Sipunculus</i>. Lamarck<a id="NtA_469" href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a>
  placed the Gephyrea near the Holothurians; and Cuvier<a id="NtA_470"
  href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> also assigned them a position amongst the Echinoderms. He
  mentions <i>Bonellia</i>, <i>Thalassema</i>, <i>Echiurus</i>, <i>Sternaspis</i>, and three species
  of <i>Sipunculus</i>, one of which, <i>S. edulis</i>, "sert de nourriture aux Chinois qui habitent
  Java, et qui vont la chercher dans le sable au moyen de petits bambous pr&eacute;par&eacute;s."</p>

  <p>The name Gephyrea<a id="NtA_471" href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> was first used by
  Quatrefages, who regarded these animals as bridging the gulf between the Worms and the
  Echinoderms. He included in this group the genus <i>Sternaspis</i> (<i>vide</i> p. <a
  href="#page335">335</a>), now more usually classed with the Chaetopoda.</p>

  <p>The Gephyrea are exclusively marine. They are subcylindrical animals, which can either retract
  the anterior end of their body&mdash;the introvert&mdash;carrying the mouth into the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page412"><span class="smaller">{412}</span></span>interior; or are provided
  with a long flexible but non-retractile proboscis. The latter is easily cast off. They usually
  bear spines or hooks of a hard chitinous character, secreted by the epidermis or outermost layer
  of cells. The mouth is at the base of the proboscis or at the end of the protractile part, the
  anus is at the other end of the body or on the dorsal surface. The nervous system consists of a
  ring round the mouth and of a ventral nerve-cord. A vascular system is present as a rule.
  Nephridia are found which act as excretory organs, and in most cases also as ducts for the
  generative cells. The Gephyrea are bisexual, and the male is sometimes degenerate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The group may be divided into four Orders:&mdash;(i.) Sipunculoidea; (ii.)
  Priapuloidea; (iii.) Echiuroidea; (iv.) Epithetosomatoidea; of these the first is by far the
  largest, both in number of genera and of species.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Anatomy of Sipunculus nudus.</b></p>

  <p><b>External Characters.</b>&mdash;The body of <i>S. nudus</i> when fully extended may attain a
  length of a foot, or even a little more; in this condition it is seen to consist of two portions,
  the anterior of which is, however, retracted into the other when the animal is disturbed. The
  retractile portion is sometimes termed the proboscis, but as its nature is entirely different from
  that of the proboscis of the Echiuroidea, it is better to refer to it as the <i>introvert</i>.
  Special retractor muscles are attached on the one hand to the body-wall about half-way down the
  body, and on the other hand are fused into a muscular sheath which surrounds the gullet, just
  behind the mouth. When these muscles contract, they withdraw the introvert into the rest of the
  body or <i>trunk</i> in much the same way as the finger of a glove may be drawn into the hand, by
  a thread fastened to the inside of its apex. The introvert is protruded by the contraction of the
  circular muscles of the body-wall. These exert a pressure on the fluid which fills the
  body-cavity, and by this means the sides of the introvert are forced forward until finally the
  head is exposed.</p>

  <p>The introvert occupies about one-sixth or one-fifth of the total body length. It is somewhat
  narrower than the trunk, and is covered by a number of small flattened papillae, some of which lie
  with their free ends directed backward, overlapping <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span
  class="smaller">{413}</span></span>one another like tiles on a roof. In some other genera, as
  <i>Phymosoma</i>, the introvert bears rows of horny hooks, which are apt to fall off as the animal
  grows old.</p>

  <p>The trunk has from thirty to thirty-two longitudinal furrows, the elevations between which
  correspond with a similar number of muscles lying in the skin. This longitudinal marking is
  crossed at right angles by a circular marking of similar origin, the elevations of which
  correspond with the circular muscles in the skin. These two sets of markings thus divide the skin
  of the trunk into a number of small square areas, very regularly arranged (Fig. 212).</p>

  <p>The outline of the trunk is more or less uniform, but it is capable of considerable change
  according to the state of contraction of its muscles. The circular muscles, for instance, may be
  contracted at one level, thus causing a constriction at this spot. The colour of <i>S. nudus</i>
  is a somewhat glistening greyish-white.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 211.</span>&mdash;Right half of the anterior end of
      <i>Sipunculus nudus</i> L., seen from the inner side and magnified. <i>a</i>, Funnel-shaped

      nerve-cord; <i>G</i>, vascular spaces in tentacular crown.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The anterior end of the fully-expanded <i>Sipunculus</i> may be termed the head; here the skin
  is produced into a frayed fringe which stands up in the shape of a funnel round the mouth. This
  fringe is grooved on its internal surface with numerous little gutters, all of them lined with
  cilia, which by their constant motion keep up a current which sweeps food into the mouth. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page414"><span class="smaller">{414}</span></span>The fringe may be in the
  form of a simple ring round the mouth, or the ring may be folded in at the dorsal side so as to
  take the form of a double horse-shoe (Figs. 211 and 212).</p>

  <p><b>Body-wall.</b>&mdash;The glistening appearance of <i>Sipunculus</i> is due to the cuticle, a
  chitinoid layer which is secreted by the external layer of cells, the <i>epidermis</i>. Beneath
  this lies a layer of connective tissue, which is not always present in other Gephyrea; within this
  lies a layer of circular muscles arranged in bundles, then comes a very thin sheath of oblique
  muscular fibres, then a thicker layer of longitudinal muscles, and finally a layer of peritoneal
  epithelial cells, which in <i>Sipunculus</i> are for the most part ciliated.</p>

  <p>Scattered over the surface of the body, and opening by narrow tubes which pierce the cuticle,
  are a number of glandular bodies which may be either bi- or multi-cellular. The glandular cells
  are apparently enlarged and modified epidermal cells; they are arranged in a cup-shaped manner,
  with their apices directed towards the orifice. They are crowded with granules, which are
  presumably poured out over the cuticle, but the exact function of the secretion is entirely
  unknown. They have a well-developed nerve supply.</p>

  <p><b>Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The mouth lies in the centre of the fringe, and is not provided
  with any kind of jaw or biting armature; it leads directly into the thin-walled alimentary canal,
  the first part of which is ciliated. The alimentary canal is not marked out into definite regions,
  but passes as a thin-walled semi-transparent tube to the posterior end of the body, and then turns
  forward again and opens to the exterior by an anus situated about an inch below the junction of
  the introvert with the trunk, on the median dorsal line. The descending and ascending limbs of the
  alimentary canal are coiled together in a spiral, which may be more or less close in different
  individuals. The whole is supported by numerous fine muscular strands, which pass from the walls
  of the intestine to the skin, and by a spindle-muscle, which runs from the extreme posterior end
  of the trunk up the axis of the spiral and terminates in the skin close to the anus.</p>

  <p>No glands open into the alimentary canal at any point of its course, but near the anus a simple
  diverticulum, or pocket, of unknown function arises. The size of this outgrowth differs <span
  class="pagenum" id="page415"><span class="smaller">{415}</span></span>enormously in different
  individuals. The alimentary canal near the anus also bears two tuft-like organs, which, however,
  do not open into the intestine, but probably have some function in connexion with the fluid in the
  body-cavity.</p>

  <p>Along the whole course of the alimentary canal there runs a ciliated groove, into which the
  food does not pass, but the cilia of which probably keep in motion a current of water whose
  function may be respiratory.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig212.jpg"><img style="width:25%" src="images/fig212.jpg" alt="fig212"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Vascular System.</b>&mdash;On the dorsal surface of the anterior end of the alimentary canal
  lies a contractile vessel, usually termed the heart. It is a tube about an inch long, ending
  blindly behind, but opening in front into a ring-shaped space surrounding the mouth and partially
  enveloping the brain. From this ring-like vessel numerous branches are given off which pass into
  the fringe round the mouth, and probably the chief function of the heart is by its contraction to
  force fluid into this fringe, and so to extend it. The heart contains a corpusculated fluid. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page416"><span class="smaller">{416}</span></span>A similar but shorter tube
  is found on the ventral surface of the anterior end of the alimentary canal in the species in
  question; it also opens into the ring which surrounds the mouth.</p>

  <p><b>Respiratory System.</b>&mdash;There are no special respiratory organs, and it has long been
  a matter of dispute where the respiration of Gephyrea is carried on. The oxygenation of the blood
  probably takes place to some extent through the walls of the oral fringe, but the blood which
  receives its oxygen at this spot is limited in its distribution, and could only supply the brain
  and head. It seems probable that the remaining organs are supplied with oxygen by the fluid of the
  body-cavity, which bathes them on all sides. This might obtain its oxygen from the blood in the
  heart, or more probably, through the thin walls of the intestine, from the stream of water which
  is maintained by the ciliated groove described above. Quite recently a form&mdash;<i>S.
  mundanus</i>, var. <i>branchiata</i>&mdash;has been described<a id="NtA_472"
  href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> with thin-walled papillae covering parts of the skin. These
  papillae are full of corpuscles, and are regarded by their discoverer as branchiae.</p>

  <p><b>Body-Cavity.</b>&mdash;The pinkish fluid of the body-cavity contains numerous corpuscles,
  the products of the reproductive organs (either ova or spermatozoa), and some curious unicellular
  bodies known as "urns." The latter are shaped like a bowl with a ciliated rim, and are formed from
  the budding of certain cells on the walls of the dorsal blood-vessel.<a id="NtA_473"
  href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> Their function is unknown, but they resemble certain
  multicellular bodies found in the body-cavity of <i>Phascolosoma</i>. The generative cells found
  in the body-cavity are further considered below. The true corpuscles are either biconcave round
  corpuscles coloured with a chemical substance, the haemerythrin of Krukenberg, which apparently
  plays the same r&ocirc;le as haemoglobin in other animals; or amoeboid corpuscles, which, though rare in
  <i>Sipunculus</i>, are very numerous in <i>Phascolosoma</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The nervous system of <i>Sipunculus</i> consists of a brain or
  cerebral ganglion, a circumoesophageal ring surrounding the gullet, and a ventral nerve-cord. The
  brain is a small bi-lobed nervous mass situated on the dorsal surface of the oesophagus, in the
  angle between the right and left dorsal retractor muscles close to their point of insertion.
  Numerous <span class="pagenum" id="page417"><span class="smaller">{417}</span></span>nerves arise
  from it, and pass to the fringe surrounding the mouth and to neighbouring parts. At the sides, the
  brain is continued into two stout nerve-cords which encircle the oesophagus, and meeting, fuse
  together in the median ventral line to form the ventral nerve-cord (Fig. 211). The latter is of
  the same diameter throughout, and shows no signs of segmentation; it is oval in section, and
  consists of small ganglion cells heaped up on the ventral surface, <i>i.e.</i> next the skin, and
  of numerous fibres situated dorsally. The cord gives off many nerves, which usually arise in
  pairs. These pass into the skin, and forming rings, run round the body, and give off finer nerves
  as they go.</p>

  <p>The nerve-cord is supported by numerous strands of muscle which pass to it from the skin. These
  are especially long in the region where the introvert joins the trunk, and thus allow free play to
  the nerve-cord when the former is being protruded or retracted.</p>

  <p><i>Sipunculus</i> is not well provided with sense-organs, but in an animal which lives buried
  in sand we should not expect to find these very highly developed. On the introvert there are
  certain patches of epithelium bearing long stout cilia, which have been regarded as tactile in
  function, and there is a tubular infolding reaching the brain, which almost certainly has some
  sensory function. Ward<a id="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> has termed this "the
  cerebral organ." It consists of a duct lined with ciliated cells, which opens to the exterior in
  the middle dorsal line outside the tentacular fringe. The duct leads down to the brain, and
  expands at its lower end into a saucer-shaped space, covering that portion of the brain where its
  substance is continuous with the external epithelium. In <i>Phymosoma</i> this cavity is produced
  into two finger-shaped processes, which are sunk into the brain and are lined by cells crowded
  with a dense black pigment.<a id="NtA_475" href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> They are probably
  rudimentary eyes, perhaps distinguishing only between darkness and light. The pits appear to be
  absent in <i>Sipunculus nudus</i>, but Andrews states they are found, although without pigment, in
  <i>S. gouldii</i>.<a id="NtA_476" href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Excretory System.</b>&mdash;The excretory organs or "brown tubes" are typical
  <i>nephridia</i>, that is to say, they consist of tubes <span class="pagenum" id="page418"><span
  class="smaller">{418}</span></span>with glandular walls which open on the one side to the
  exterior, and on the other by means of a ciliated funnel-shaped opening into the body-cavity. In
  Gephyrea one wall of the tube is produced into a long diverticulum or sac which hangs down into
  the body-cavity, and is usually supported by muscle-fibres running to the body-wall. The lower end
  of the sac is broken up into a number of crypts or pits, lined by large glandular cells crowded
  with brown pigment. The pigment-granules are secreted into the cavity of the sac, and leave the
  body through the external opening; they probably consist of the nitrogenous excreta of the animal.
  The upper end of the sac, into which both the external and internal orifices open, is usually
  enlarged, and its walls are very muscular. As in so many other animals, the nephridia serve as
  ducts through which the reproductive cells leave the body of the parent.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive System.</b>&mdash;The Gephyrea are bisexual. In <i>Sipunculus</i> the testes
  and ovaries are found in the same position in the two sexes, and are indistinguishable without
  microscopic investigation. They each consist of small ridges situated at the lower end of the
  ventral retractor muscles, just where the latter take their origin from the longitudinal muscles
  of the skin. At this level the cells which line the body-cavity on the inside of the skin are
  heaped up, and become modified in the one case into ova or eggs, and in the other into the
  mother-cells of the spermatozoa. This method of forming the reproductive organs from modified
  cells lining the body-cavity is very common in the higher animals; but it is seen in its simplest
  and least modified form in the Sipunculidae.</p>

  <p>The eggs break away from the ovary in a very undeveloped condition, but whilst floating about
  in the body-cavity they increase in size and secrete a thick membrane around them. They have a
  well-marked nucleus, and are oval in outline.</p>

  <p>The mother-cells of the spermatozoa also break away in an immature condition, and complete
  their development in the nutritive fluid of the body-cavity. They divide into a number of
  spermatozoa, usually eight or sixteen, which remain in contact. They each develop a tail, which
  projects outwards, and aids the cluster in swimming along. These clusters of spermatozoa are about
  the same size as the ova of the female, and, like them, make their way into the "brown tubes." The
  exact way in <span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span class="smaller">{419}</span></span>which
  this is accomplished is not very clear, but the cilia on the funnel-shaped internal opening of the
  tube seem to have some power of selecting the generative cells when they come within their reach,
  and of passing them on, whilst they reject the much smaller corpuscles of the perivisceral fluid,
  which are never found in the nephridia.<a id="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> Once

  <p><b>Development.</b>&mdash;Hatschek,<a id="NtA_478" href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> who
  investigated the development of <i>Sipunculus nudus</i> at Pantano, an inlet of the sea near
  Messina, states that the spawning takes place during the night, and ceases about July 10. The rate
  of development depends upon the temperature, but the larvae usually free themselves from the
  egg-membrane during the third day. When hatched the embryos lengthen out a good deal, and take the
  form represented in Fig. 213. The larva swims actively by means of a ring of stout cilia, which
  encircle the body just behind the mouth. Other shorter cilia are found on the head, continuing
  into the lining of the mouth, and a little bunch of them is situated at the extreme posterior end.
  The alimentary canal is already formed, and is twisted, so that the anus lies dorsally, but not so
  far forward as it does in the adult. A glandular structure opens into the mouth, and another body
  of unknown function is connected with the oesophagus; both these disappear during larval life. A
  pair of excretory tubules, the <span class="pagenum" id="page420"><span
  class="smaller">{420}</span></span>forerunners of the brown tubes, are found, and the chief muscle
  tracts are already established. The nervous system is still in close connexion with the skin, from
  the outer part of which it is derived; the cerebral thickening bears two eye-spots.</p>

  <p>The fluid of the body-cavity contains corpuscles, which are kept in active circulation by the
  constant contractions of the body-wall, and by numerous tufts of cilia which are borne on the
  inner surface of the skin. The dorsal blood-vessel is one of the latest organs to arise.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The larva swims actively about for a month, during which time it increases greatly
  in size; it then undergoes a somewhat sudden metamorphosis. The ciliated ring and the structures
  related to the oesophagus begin to disappear, the distinction between the head and the rest of the
  body is obliterated, and the head becomes relatively small. The mouth changes its position, and
  becomes terminal instead of being somewhat ventral, and the tentacular membrane begins to appear.
  At the same time the larva relinquishes its free-swimming life, and sinks to the bottom; it begins
  creeping amongst the sand by protruding and retracting the anterior part of its body, and takes on
  all the characters and habits of the adult.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>I. Order Sipunculoidea.</b></p>

  <p>Besides the genus <i>Sipunculus</i>, the Order Sipunculoidea includes ten other genera. A key
  to these, taken for the most part from Selenka's admirable monograph, is given on page 424.</p>

  <p><i>Phascolosoma</i> contains, in comparison with <i>Sipunculus</i>, only small species, and it
  is easily distinguished by the fact that the longitudinal muscles are fused into a continuous
  sheath. As a rule the skin is smooth. A few species bear hooks, which are generally scattered
  irregularly and not arranged in transverse rows, as in <i>Phymosoma</i> (Fig. 214) and most of the
  other genera.</p>

  <p>The fold which in <i>S. nudus</i> surrounds the mouth may be in the same species bent in so as
  to take the form of a double horse-shoe, the opening of which is always dorsal, just above the
  brain; in this case the mouth is crescentiform. In other genera the fold is broken up into
  discrete tentacles, and these are variously arranged; in <i>Dendrostoma</i> they are grouped
  together in four or six bundles round the mouth, but the more usual <span class="pagenum"
  id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span>arrangement is the horse-shoe-like row of
  tentacles which overhang the crescentiform mouth, as in <i>Phymosoma</i> and some species of
  <i>Aspidosiphon</i>.</p>

  <p>The ventral side of each tentacle is grooved and ciliated, and the grooves are continued into
  the ciliated mouth. Their dorsal surface is pigmented, and in the hollow of the horse-shoe lies a
  deeply pigmented epithelium covering the brain.</p>

  <p>A blood-vessel courses up each tentacle, and usually two channels return the blood to the
  vascular ring which surrounds the mouth. In those forms which possess tentacles on the dorsal side
  of the mouth only, the ventral part of the vascular ring lies in the lower lip, which is tumid and
  swollen. The brain supplies a nerve to each tentacle.</p>

  <p>When the introvert is retracted the tentacular ring is withdrawn and to some extent collapsed;
  in this condition it would be almost touching the rough external surface of the introvert. In some
  species of <i>Phymosoma</i> the delicate appendages of the head are guarded from the hooks on the
  introvert by a thin membrane or collar,<a id="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> which
  completely ensheaths the retracted head.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the introvert is fully extended the dorsal blood-vessel contracts and sends its blood
  forward into the vascular ring, and thence into the tentacles or tentacular fold, which are thus
  erected. In several species of <i>Sipunculus</i>, as <i>S. nudus</i>, <i>S. norvegicus</i>, <i>S.
  robustus</i>, <i>S. tesselatus</i>, there is a ventral blind tube as well as a dorsal, into which
  the blood is withdrawn when the head is retracted. In many other species in various genera, such
  as <i>Phymosoma <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>weldonii</i> and <i>Ph. asser</i>, <i>Dendrostoma signifer</i>,
  <i>S. vastus</i>, the lumen of the dorsal vessel is increased by numerous hollow blind processes
  which it bears, hanging freely into the body-cavity. Three very small genera of
  Sipunculids&mdash;<i>Onchnesoma</i>, <i>Petalostoma</i>, and <i>Tylosoma</i>&mdash;are devoid of
  all trace of vascular system and of tentacles; the mouth opens in the centre of the anterior end
  of the introvert. In <i>Onchnesoma</i> the dorsal part of the lip is somewhat produced, so that
  the head has somewhat the shape of a Doge's cap, and in <i>Petalostoma</i> there are two leaf-like
  processes of the body-wall which guard the mouth.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the intestine is coiled varies very much even in the same species; the axis
  of the coil is often supported by a spindle-muscle, but this is sometimes absent. The caecum,
  which opens into the rectum of <i>S. nudus</i>, is again a very variable structure, and when it is
  present varies remarkably in size.</p>

  <p>The food of Sipunculids seems to consist almost entirely of sand, and their only nourishment
  must be such small microscopic organisms or particles of animal and vegetable d&eacute;bris as are to be
  found mixed with the sand. The alimentary canal is, as a rule, quite full of sand, and yet in
  spite of the tenuity of its walls they never seem to be ruptured. If the contents of the digestive
  tube be washed out with a pipette, it will be found that it requires considerable force to
  dislodge many of the sand-particles lying next the wall. These are more or less embedded in crypts
  or pockets of the wall, and as the sand passes along the intestine they probably serve as more or
  less fixed hard points, against which the sharp edges of the sand particles are worn off. Amongst
  the sand are usually to be found pieces of shell, sometimes with a diameter equal to that of the
  alimentary canal; these are usually rounded, but their angles may have been removed by attrition
  before they entered the mouth of the Sipunculid.</p>

  <p>In <i>S. tesselatus</i> the sand is to some extent held together by a mucous deposit; in those
  cases where there is no sand in the intestine, there is always a coagulum of mucus, and the walls
  are contracted and thick; when full of sand the walls are tensely stretched and very thin. This
  thinness of the wall of the alimentary canal seems ill-adapted to a diet of sand, nevertheless it
  is also met with in other great sand-eating groups of animals, such as the Echinids and the
  Holothurians.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span class="smaller">{423}</span></span></div>

  <p>The enormous amount of sand and mud which passes through the bodies of the Sipunculids shows
  that they must take a considerable part in modifying the mineral substances which form the bottom
  of the sea. Just as earthworms, as shown by Darwin, play a considerable r&ocirc;le in the formation of
  soil, so must these animals, in conjunction with Echinids and Holothurians, effect considerable
  modifications in the sand and mud which pass through their bodies. Mr. J. Y. Buchanan<a
  id="NtA_480" href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> is "led to believe that the principal agent in
  the comminution of the mineral matter found at the bottom of both deep and shallow seas and
  oceans, is the ground fauna of the sea, which depends for its subsistence on the organic matter
  which it can extract from the mud." The minerals at the bottom of the sea are exposed to a
  reducing process in passing through the bodies of the animals which eat them, and subsequently to
  an oxidising process due to the oxygen dissolved in the sea-water acting on the minerals extruded
  from the animals' bodies.</p>

  <p>The rate at which the sand passes through the body of <i>Sipunculus</i> is unfortunately
  unknown, but that at any one moment a considerable quantity is contained in the intestine is shown
  by the fact that the average weight of five specimens of <i>S. nudus</i> from Naples, taken at
  random, was 19.08 grms., whilst the average weight of sand washed out of their alimentary canal
  was 10.03 grms. The sand contained in five other specimens of the same species measured
  respectively 6 c.c., 7 c.c., 6.5 c.c., 7.5 c.c., and 7.5 c.c., giving an average of 6.9 c.c. for
  each individual.</p>

  <p><i>Onchnesoma</i> and <i>Tylosoma</i> have only one retractor muscle; <i>Aspidosiphon</i> and
  <i>Phascolion</i> have, as a rule, two; <i>Phymosoma</i> and <i>Sipunculus</i> have four, and
  perhaps this is the more usual number.</p>

  <p><i>Phascolion</i>, <i>Tylosoma</i>, and <i>Onchnesoma</i> have but one "brown tube"; in
  <i>Phascolion</i> this is the right, in <i>Onchnesoma</i> it is sometimes the right and sometimes
  the left that persists. Most other genera retain two, but there are many exceptions; for instance,
  <i>Phascolosoma squamatum</i> has but one, and so has <i>Aspidosiphon tortus</i>, and in both
  cases it is that of the left side. No Sipunculid has more than two. It has been pointed out by
  Selenka that those species which have but one brown <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span
  class="smaller">{424}</span></span>tube are, as a rule, inhabitants of tubes or shells, and do not
  move actively about in the sand.</p>

  <p>The eggs of all members of the family, with the exception of the genus <i>Phymosoma</i>, are
  spherical, but those of the last-named genus are elliptical. They are always surrounded by a thick
  membrane, the "zona radiata," pierced by numerous pores.</p>

  <p><i>Aspidosiphon</i> (Fig. 215) is easily recognised by the presence of two
  symmetrically-arranged cuticular shields, one at each end of the trunk. These are formed by the
  fusion of minute cuticular plates, such as exist in the skin of most Sipunculids. The posterior
  shield is radially symmetrical, but the anterior is somewhat like the shell of a Pecten, and
  symmetrical only about one plane. The introvert is protruded from the acute angle of the anterior
  shield, and when extended lies almost at right angles to the trunk, instead of being, as is
  usually the case, in the same straight line with it. In many specimens, and these seem as a rule
  to be the older ones, a deposit of calcium carbonate takes place over these shields, covering over
  and concealing their external markings.</p>

  <p><i>Cloeosiphon</i> (<i>Echinosiphon</i>) has a calcareous ring, consisting of four or five rows
  of lozenge-shaped calcareous bodies forming a close mosaic, arranged round the base of the
  introvert, which when extended is in the same straight line as the trunk. Each piece bears a brown
  spot, which is said to be the pore of a gland (Fig. 217). <i>Golfingia</i> Lankester, has a
  cylindrical horny thickening at the anterior end of the trunk and another at the posterior.</p>

  <p><b>Species of Sipunculoidea.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Phymosoma</i> (Fig. 214) contains more
  species than any other genus of Sipunculoidea, and they are all of fair size. Twenty-seven species
  are known, of which seventeen occur in the Malay Archipelago, thirteen being found there alone.
  <i>Phymosoma</i> affects shallow water, the deepest specimens being taken at a depth of about 50
  fathoms; this may be due to the fact that they flourish only in comparatively warm water. With
  very few exceptions, they are found only in tropical seas, very often living in tubular
  excavations made in soft coral rock.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Sipunculus</i> contains sixteen species. They are the largest and the most
  conspicuous members of the group. They have a very wide distribution, some species, as <i>S.
  nudus</i> (Fig. 212) and <i>S. australis</i>, being almost cosmopolitan. They are most common in
  temperate and tropical seas, but <i>S. norvegicus</i> and <i>S. priapuloides</i> are found far
  north, but always at considerable depths, 100 to 200 fathoms.</p>

  <p>The following account of the habits of <i>Sipunculus gouldii</i> is taken from Mr. Andrews'<a
  id="NtA_482" href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> paper on that species<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"This <i>Sipunculus</i> is very abundant in certain small areas of compact, fine sand darkened
  by organic matter and not laid bare at ordinary low tide. In such places, only a few square metres
  in extent, they pierce the sand in all directions to a depth of more than half a metre, making
  burrows with persistent lumen running from the surface downward and then laterally, but with no
  regularity in direction.</p>

  <p>"Kept in aquaria, the dependence of the animal upon the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page427"><span class="smaller">{427}</span></span>nature of the sand and its method of
  locomotion may be readily observed. A vigorous individual buries itself in a few moments in the
  following manner: Running out the introvert to nearly its full extent, and applying it to the
  surface of the sand till some spot of less resistance is found, the animal still further expands
  the introvert so that it penetrates the sand, provided this is not too dense and firm, for then
  the body is merely shoved backward. When the introvert is inserted, the contraction of the
  longitudinal muscles of the body-wall brings the whole body forward somewhat, in case the
  introvert is fixed in the sand. In case soft ooze was present, this fixation did not take place,
  and the introvert was merely pulled out again, but when the sand was of the right consistency the
  introvert was fixed by becoming much swollen at the tip, and then constricted just posterior to
  this swollen area. This bulb-like area exerts lateral pressure on the sand, as could be seen by
  movements of the grains. The swelling of the anterior end of the introvert is brought about by the
  body-wall contracting elsewhere, and forcing in liquid to distend that end. Owing to the curved
  form assumed by the body in the normal contracted state when first removed from its burrow, the
  entrance of the introvert may often be nearly vertical, and hence the entire body is soon raised
  nearly upright in the water above the sand. If the body has thus been warped forward sufficiently
  to become somewhat fixed in the sand, the introvert is rolled in and again thrust forward from
  this new point of resistance, and so on till the animal is entirely buried. This locomotion
  increases in speed as the creature becomes more completely surrounded by sand, and is the only
  means of moving from place to place.</p>

  <p>"On a smooth surface, or on one not presenting the right degree of resistance, the
  <i>Sipunculus</i> does not change its position, but remains till death finally occurs, rolling its
  introvert in and out and contracting its body-wall to no purpose.</p>

  <p>"The essential factors in the mechanism bringing about this hydrostatic locomotion are an
  elongated contractile sac filled with liquid, and some means of definitely co-ordinating the
  contractions of the sac.</p>

  <p>"In natural environment the animals are found with sometimes one, sometimes the other end
  nearer the surface of the sand: in the aquaria the same was observed, but when the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page428"><span class="smaller">{428}</span></span>water became stagnant and
  impure the anterior end with expanded branchiae was often protruded somewhat above the surface of
  the sand."</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Phascolosoma</i> contains at least twenty-five species, for the most part small.
  <i>Ph. margaritaceum</i>, however, measures<a id="NtA_483" href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> 10
  cm. in length, and <i>Ph. flagriferum</i>, 13 cm. The latter is produced at the hinder end of its
  trunk into a long whip-like process, which recalls the horny spike of <i>Golfingia</i>. Most
  species live free, but a few inhabit the shells of dead Gasteropods or of <i>Dentalium</i>, or the
  abandoned tubes of worms. They occur in practically all seas.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Dendrostoma</i> contains but five species, which are all found within the tropics in the

  tide-marks.</p>

  <p><i>Phascolion</i> is a smaller genus, containing but ten species, which may have been derived
  independently from different species of <i>Phascolosoma</i>, and in this case the genus should be
  broken up. The members of this genus live in Mollusc shells, such as <i>Dentalium</i>,
  <i>Turritella</i>, <i>Buccinum</i>, <i>Chenopus</i> (<i>Aporrhais</i>), <i>Nassa</i>,
  <i>Strombus</i>, and generally acquire the coiled shape of their host. They are usually attached
  to the shell by means of certain <span class="pagenum" id="page429"><span
  class="smaller">{429}</span></span>adhesive papillae found on their posterior end. <i>Ph.
  strombi</i> fills its shell with mud, which must be kept together by some secretion of the animal.
  The body lies in a tube in this mud, and the introvert projects from the small round opening at
  the end of the tube, and explores the ground in every direction. They are found in all seas, but
  more especially in the colder waters.</p>

  <p>Two species of <i>Aspidosiphon</i> have been described by Bouvier<a id="NtA_484"
  href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> living in a state of commensalism with two species of
  Madreporarian corals, <i>Stephanoceris rousseaui</i> and <i>Heteropsammia cochlea</i>, which live
  on and surrounding the shells of certain Molluscs at Aden (Fig. 216). Apparently the Gephyrean
  takes up its abode within its house at a tender age, and according to Bouvier, it provides for its
  increasing bulk by secreting a coiled calcareous tube, the outer surface of which affords space
  for the growth of the coral.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cloeosiphon</i>, the <i>Echinosiphon</i> of Sluiter, includes three species: <i>C.
  aspergillum</i> (Fig. 217), <i>C. molle</i>, and <i>C. javanicum</i>. The first named occurs at
  Mauritius, the Malay Archipelago, and neighbouring islands; the others are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page430"><span class="smaller">{430}</span></span>confined to the last-named area, which thus
  again forms the headquarters of a genus.</p>

  <p><i>Golfingia</i>, described by Lankester from a single specimen, was dredged in St. Andrews
  Bay, at the depth of 10 fathoms.</p>

  <p><i>Petalostoma</i> comprises but one species, <i>P. minutum</i>, which is found in the English
  Channel.</p>

  <p><i>Onchnesoma</i> comprises two species, <i>O. steenstrupii</i> and <i>O. sarsii</i>, both
  found off the coast of Norway at considerable depths between 200 and 300 fathoms.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Tylosoma</i> comprises one species, <i>T. l&uuml;tkenii</i>, also from the Norwegian
  coast. It is dredged from stony ground in 50 to 80 fathoms.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>II. Order Priapuloidea.</b></p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;This Order consists of the two genera <i>Priapulus</i> and
  <i>Halicryptus</i>. Both are cylindrical animals with the mouth at one end and the anus at the
  other. The introvert is short, and is covered with rows of chitinous spines, which are continued
  to some extent over the body.</p>

  <p>The skin is folded in a series of rings, and the body is usually somewhat swollen posteriorly.
  <i>P. caudatus</i> bears a curious caudal appendage, beset with a number of hollow lobes somewhat
  grape-like in appearance. This is situated ventral to the anus; its lumen is continuous with that
  of the body-cavity, but it can be separated from it by the action of a sphincter muscle. Two such
  appendages exist in <i>P. bicaudatus</i>.</p>

  <p>There cannot be said to be any head in the Priapuloidea; they have no tentacles or tentacular
  fringe, no proboscis, and no distinct brain; simply a round aperture, the mouth, which is
  surrounded by a groove in the skin, at the bottom of which the circumoesophageal nerve-cord lies.
  The mouth leads into a very muscular pharynx lined with stout chitinous teeth; this passes into an
  intestine, which is as a rule straight, but in <i>P. glandifer</i> it has a single loop.</p>

  <p>The Priapuloidea possess no vascular system and no brown tubes. Their skin has in the main the
  same structure as that of the Sipunculids, with spines, glandular bodies, and papillae with
  sensory hairs which resemble similar structures on <i>Phymosoma varians</i>. Retractor muscles
  arise from the longitudinal muscles <span class="pagenum" id="page431"><span
  class="smaller">{431}</span></span>of the skin, and are inserted into the pharynx; they are short
  and not constant in number.</p>

  <p>The nervous system has retained throughout its primitive connexion with the epidermis. In
  almost all animals the nervous system is formed from the epiblast or outermost cellular layer of
  the embryo; it usually, however, breaks away from this and sinks into the body. Thus in
  <i>Sipunculus</i> it lies within the body-cavity, and has retained its primitive connexion with
  the outer layers of the skin only in the region of the brain; but in the Priapulids the nervous
  system, which consists of a ring round the mouth and of a ventral cord, lies embedded in the skin,
  and the nerve cells are directly continuous with the cells of the epidermis. The nerve-ring lies
  at the base of a groove in the skin, which forms a kind of gutter round the mouth; the ventral
  nerve-cord is visible exteriorly as a light line which marks the ventral surface of the animal. In
  no place is the ring or cord differentiated in any way, and there cannot be said to be any brain
  or special sense-organs. Numerous nerves are given off from the ring to the pharynx and intestine,
  and from the cord to the body-wall.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sexes are distinct, but they differ from the other Gephyrea in the nature of their
  reproductive organs. In mature specimens the ovaries or testes are easily recognisable, lying to
  the right and left of the alimentary canal. The reproductive glands are continuous with ducts,
  which act as oviducts and vasa deferentia respectively. Both glands and ducts are attached to the
  body-wall by a mesentery.</p>

  <p>The excretory function is performed in the Priapuloidea by the ducts of the generative organs.
  These are primarily connected with a number of branching canals of small size which project into
  the body-cavity. According to Schauinsland,<a id="NtA_485" href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> one
  or more pear-shaped cells are found at the end of each branch, and each is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page432"><span class="smaller">{432}</span></span>continued into a long cilium which hangs
  down into the lumen of the canal, and by its movement produces a flickering motion. Beyond the
  free end of the large cilium the canal is lined with ciliated cells. The remarkable resemblance
  this form of excretory organ presents to that of the Platyhelminthes (<i>vide</i> p. <a
  href="#page25">25</a>) and of certain Chaetopods is worthy of attention. In the young Priapuloidea
  the duct with its branching canals is not masked by the generative organs, but as the animals
  become mature, diverticula from the duct arise, and the cells covering these become modified into
  ova in the female, and into spermatozoa in the male. The presence of these follicles masks the
  excretory part of the gland. The ova and spermatozoa escape through the ciliated ducts which open
  to the exterior one on each side of the anus, and, contrary to what is the case with other
  Gephyrea, leave the body without having ever been in the body-cavity.</p>

  <p>Nothing is known of the embryology of either member of this family, but both genera appear to
  be sexually mature from the end of May until October.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The two genera which make up the Order Priapuloidea are
  characterised as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><i>Priapulus.</i>&mdash;The body is continued into one or two caudal appendages, beset with
  hollow papillae; these are ventral to the anus. The introvert forms &frac14; to &#x2153; of the total
  body-length; it is covered with spines in conspicuous longitudinal rows, the rest of the body
  being ringed. The retractor muscles are numerous, and are attached to the body-wall, some
  anteriorly and some posteriorly.</p>

  <p>The genus includes the following five species:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p><i>P. caudatus</i> Lam. (Fig. 218). <i>Hab.</i> Coasts of Greenland, Norway, Great Britain,
    the North Sea, and the Baltic.</p>
    <p><i>P. bicaudatus</i> Dan. <i>Hab.</i> North Sea and Arctic Ocean.</p>
    <p><i>P. glandifer</i> Ehlers. <i>Hab.</i> Coast of Greenland, North Sea.</p>
    <p><i>P. brevicaudatus</i> Ehlers. <i>Hab.</i> North Sea and Baltic, from ten fathoms.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>P. tuberculato-spinosus</i> Baird. <i>Hab.</i> Falkland Islands.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Halicryptus.</i>&mdash;No caudal appendages. Introvert &#x2152; to <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span> of the total body length, with numerous
  spines arranged in close circles. Retractors numerous and all attached to the body-wall
  anteriorly.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>H. spinulosus</i> v.&nbsp;Sieb. (Fig. 219). <i>Hab.</i> North Sea, Arctic
    Ocean, and Baltic, in from two to fifty fathoms.</p>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page433"><span class="smaller">{433}</span></span></div>

  <p>It will be noticed that with the exception of <i>P. tuberculato-spinosus</i>, described by
  Baird from a single specimen, the whole family is confined to northern seas.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The newly-captured specimens of both <i>P. caudatus</i> and <i>H.
  spinulosus</i> are of a flesh colour, with a somewhat metallic sheen. According to Apel, the
  latter lived in an aquarium for more than five months, whilst the former died during the first
  month. When first introduced into the aquarium they immediately began to busy themselves in the
  mud or sand at its bottom, and very seldom showed themselves above it. They forced their way into
  the sand by alternately contracting and extending their introvert, and the <i>Priapulus</i>
  arranged itself so that a portion, often a very small one, of its caudal appendage was exposed to
  the water; this fact supports the view that the appendage is respiratory in function. When the
  animal buries itself deeply, the appendage does not relinquish its position at the surface of the
  sand, but stretches itself until it in some cases surpasses the length of the body. On the other
  hand, <i>Halicryptus</i> (Fig. 219), according to the same observer, lies with the anterior end,
  the mouth, projecting from the surface of the sand, or else it curves itself, so that both ends
  project into the water.</p>

  <p>Leckenby, who described specimens of <i>P. caudatus</i> which were found by fishermen searching
  for worms for bait in the outer harbour at Scarborough at half tide, states that they live in
  sandy clay in <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped tubes, at a depth of about 9 inches, the
  tubes opening at each end on to the surface of the sand. The fishermen of this district call them
  "sea mushrooms."</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Halicryptus</i> casts its cuticle in May and September; it becomes loose first
  at the hinder end, and the split between it and the skin grows forward until the animal lies free
  in a cuticular mantle. After some days this is split, and the animal frees itself from it; the
  cast-off cuticle includes for a short <span class="pagenum" id="page434"><span
  class="smaller">{434}</span></span>distance the lining of the mouth, the anus, and the two
  generative pores.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>III. Order Echiuroidea.</b></p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The most striking peculiarity of the Echiuroidea, as opposed to the other
  two families of the Gephyrea, is the presence of a solid dorsal outgrowth of a portion of the
  head, forming the proboscis. The nature of this proboscis is something quite different from that
  of the introvert of the Sipunculoidea; it would appear to correspond to an extension, in the
  members of the last-named Order, of that part of the head which is dorsal to the mouth and is
  covered by a peculiar pigment-epithelium, often in continuity with the brain. In its outgrowth
  this portion of the body has carried with it the nerve-ring and the vascular ring, which both
  surround the mouth. The proboscis is found in all the genera with the exception of the aberrant
  genus <i>Saccosoma</i>.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The body of the female <i>Bonellia viridis</i>, one of the best known species of Echiurids, is
  shaped like a small sausage, and is usually about 2 inches long. The proboscis arises from the
  anterior end, and is extremely extensible. At the distal end the proboscis splits into two short
  arms, which are often recurved; along the whole ventral surface runs a groove lined with cilia,
  which by the approximation of its edges can be converted into a tube. At the bottom of the
  proboscis the groove opens into the mouth. <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span
  class="smaller">{435}</span></span><i>Echiurus</i>; <i>Thalassema</i>, and the female
  <i>Hamingia</i> have short proboscides, which do not bifurcate but otherwise resemble those of the
  female <i>Bonellia</i>.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig221.jpg"><img style="width:37%" src="images/fig221.jpg" alt="fig221"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The green colour of <i>B. viridis</i> is due to a special pigment, "Bonellein," which at one
  time was thought to be identical with chlorophyll. A similar green colour is found in <i>Hamingia
  arctica</i>, <i>Thalassema baronii</i>, and the larvae of many forms.</p>

  <p>A short distance behind the mouth, on the ventral surface, the female <i>Bonellia</i> and both
  sexes of <i>Thalassema</i> and <i>Echiurus</i> bear two incurved stout chitinous hooks; these gave
  the name <span class="pagenum" id="page436"><span class="smaller">{436}</span></span>Gephyrea
  Armata to the above-mentioned genera. In addition to these, <i>Echiurus</i> has a row of chitinous
  bristles surrounding the posterior end of the body; the row is single in <i>E. unicinctus</i>,
  double in <i>E. pallasii</i>. These bristles are formed, like the hooks on the introvert of the
  Sipunculoidea, by epidermal cells; those of <i>B. minor</i> and of the posterior rings in
  <i>Echiurus</i> are said to arise each from a single cell, just as the bristles do in
  Chaetopods.</p>

  <p>The skin consists of very much the same layers as does that of <i>Sipunculus</i>; the cuticle
  is thin, the epidermis is modified into numerous glandular cells, papillae, and pits, from which
  the bristles arise. A third layer of oblique or circular fibres is usually found inside the
  longitudinal muscle-layer. The proboscis is solid, and contains much connective-tissue and
  numerous muscle-fibres running in all directions; the ventral groove is ciliated.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal in the Echiuroidea consists of a long thin-walled tube with numerous
  convolutions; it is not coiled as in Sipunculids, but the loops are irregularly arranged, and are
  supported by numerous fine muscular strands which run from the skin. There is a ciliated groove
  running along one side of the intestine, as in the Sipunculids. The anus is terminal. The most
  striking peculiarity of the alimentary canal of the Echiurids is the existence of a collateral
  intestine or "siphon." This is a narrow tube which arises from the main canal not very far from
  the mouth, and re-enters it again lower down. A similar structure occurs in some Echinids, and in
  the Capitelliformia (pp. <a href="#page272">272</a>, <a href="#page305">305</a>). Its function is
  not certainly known.</p>

  <p>Another characteristic feature of the Echiurids is the presence of "anal vesicles," branching
  structures which unite into a common stem opening into the intestine close to the anus. The free
  end of each of the branches terminates in a ciliated funnel-shaped opening. The function of these
  structures may be excretory, or they may control the amount of fluid in the body-cavity.</p>

  <p>A closed vascular system exists in Echiurids, consisting of a contractile dorsal vessel running
  along the dorsal surface of the anterior end of the alimentary canal, and continued along the axis
  of the proboscis. At the tip of the proboscis it bifurcates, and each branch descends along the
  edge until it reaches the base where, having encircled the oesophagus, the two unite, and are
  continued as the ventral vessel which runs along the dorsal surface of the nerve-cord, and
  eventually ends blindly. There is also a vessel which <span class="pagenum" id="page437"><span
  class="smaller">{437}</span></span>passes from the ventral vessel and encircles the intestine,
  opening into the posterior end of the dorsal vessel. In <i>Echiurus</i> the same vessel encircles
  a stout muscle which runs from the base of one of the ventral bristles to the other. In
  <i>Thalassema</i> Lankester states that the fluid within the vessels is colourless, and does not
  contain corpuscles similar to those in the body-cavity fluid.</p>

  <p>The "brown tubes" or nephridia vary in number in the Echiurids. In the female <i>Bonellia</i>
  there is but one; in <i>B. viridis</i> the right, in <i>B. minor</i> the left usually persists. In
  shape, colour, contractility, and minute structure they closely resemble those of
  <i>Sipunculus</i>. <i>Hamingia</i> is said to have a pair of brown tubes; <i>Echiurus</i> has two
  pairs, except <i>E. chilensis</i>, which has three; their internal openings are produced into long
  coiled slits in some genera. <i>Thalassema gigas</i> has one pair; <i>Th. neptuni</i>, <i>Th.
  baronii</i>, <i>Th. formosulum</i>, and <i>Th. exilii</i>, two; whilst <i>Th. vegrande</i>, <i>Th.
  moebii</i>, <i>Th. erythrogrammon</i>, <i>Th. caudex</i>, and <i>Th. sorbillans</i> have three
  pairs.</p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of a ventral cord lying in the body-cavity, as in the
  Sipunculoidea, but attached to the skin, and of a circumoesophageal ring. With the growth of the
  proboscis this ring is drawn out, and the two branches run along the sides of the proboscis and
  unite at the tip. There is no specialisation of brain, nor are any special sense organs present,
  but the ventral cord gives off paired nerves at regular intervals, which, uniting dorsally, form
  rings in the skin in some and probably in all species.</p>

  <p>The perivisceral fluid is of a dark brown colour in <i>Thalassema</i>, containing numerous
  spherical corpuscles deeply impregnated, according to Lankester, with haemoglobin, and also
  containing granules of a brown pigment. Haemoglobin is also found in certain of the muscles and in
  part of the epithelial lining of the body-cavity. Lankester also describes the presence of
  haemoglobin in the corpuscles of the perivisceral fluid in <i>Hamingia</i>.</p>

  <p>The genital glands are, like those of the Sipunculoidea, formed by a special development of the
  cells lining the body-cavity. These cells are massed together along the wall of the ventral
  blood-vessel. In <i>Echiurus</i> and in <i>Thalassema</i> the cells break off and float in the
  body-cavity, developing into ova and spermatozoa. In <i>Bonellia</i> each cell does not become an
  egg, but a mass of cells breaks off, one of which increases in size at the expense of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page438"><span class="smaller">{438}</span></span>others and forms the ovum.
  The mature sexual cells leave the body through the nephridia.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  </div>

  <p><i>Bonellia</i> and <i>Hamingia</i> present very interesting cases of sexual dimorphism.  In
  both genera the female is an animal of considerable size with the normal structure of the
  Echiuroidea, but the male (Fig. 222) is a microscopic Planarian-like animal, which lives in the
  mouth and in the nephridia of the female. Both in <i>Bonellia</i><a id="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> and in <i>Hamingia</i> the male is provided with a pair of
  hook-like ventral bristles; these are wanting in the female <i>Hamingia</i>. The surface of the
  male is ciliated, and the skin <span class="pagenum" id="page439"><span
  class="smaller">{439}</span></span>contains circular and longitudinal muscle-fibres. The
  body-cavity is developed, but does not reach to either end of the body. The alimentary canal is
  closed, neither mouth nor anus existing; it is supported by regularly arranged dorso-ventral
  muscle strands. A nerve-ring and a ventral cord exist. There are also two rudimentary organs
  corresponding with the anal vesicles of the female, and a single nephridium which acts as a duct
  for the spermatozoa; the latter arise from modified cells lining the body-cavity.</p>

  <p>In both sexes the larvae develop to a certain stage without showing any trace of sexual
  differentiation, but after this stage, the development of the male is to a certain extent
  arrested; in some respects, indeed, it undergoes retrogressive changes. At this time it is found
  clinging to the proboscis of the female, thence it makes its way to the mouth, where it undergoes
  its final change; and then creeping out, finds its way into the nephridium of the female, and
  spends the rest of its life there in a special recess cut off by a fold from the excretory part of
  this organ. In <i>Hamingia</i>, however, Lankester, who first described the male, did not find any
  in the nephridia, but found five specimens, each <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">12</span> inch long, within the dilated pharynx of the female.</p>

  <p><b>Development.</b>&mdash;In <i>Bonellia</i> and <i>Hamingia</i> it seems probable that the ova
  are fertilised in the nephridium of the female; in the other genera they are fertilised in the
  water after leaving the body of the mother.</p>

  <p>In <i>Thalassema</i> and <i>Echiurus</i> the growth of the embryo results in the formation of a
  typical Trochosphere larva, a type widely spread in the animal kingdom, being found in the
  Chaetopoda (Fig. 145, A), Polyzoa (p. <a href="#page510">510</a>), and Mollusca. The large
  prae-oral lobe persists in the Echiuroidea as the proboscis; the mouth is ventral in position,
  with usually a ring of cilia encircling the body in front of and behind it; the anus is posterior
  and terminal. A pair of larval excretory organs are present, and a special nervous aggregation of
  cells at the apex of the prae-oral lobe is usually indicated by the presence of a bunch of long
  cilia.</p>

  <p>The trunk of the Trochosphere is unsegmented, and in certain groups of animals it remains so,
  but in Chaetopods, and in <i>Echiurus</i> and <i>Thalassema</i>, it elongates and becomes divided
  <span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span class="smaller">{440}</span></span>up into a series of
  somites or segments. Of these there are fifteen in <i>Echiurus</i>, and apparently eleven in
  <i>Th. mellita</i>; in this stage the Gephyrean larvae have again so close a resemblance to the
  segmenting Chaetopod larvae as to be easily mistaken for them. The segmentation is shown in the
  following way: (i.) the middle layer of cells or mesoblast is typically segmented, and forms
  septa, which separate each segment from its neighbours; (ii.) the ventral nerve-cord arises as
  segmentally-arranged thickenings of the epiblast, which fuse together, but retain their segmented
  appearance for some time; (iii.) the skin shows the segmentation of the body both by the
  arrangement of the pigment and by bands of cilia. The latter are replaced in the adult by rows of
  spines, and on the fourteenth and fifteenth segments in <i>Echiurus pallasii</i> by the two
  peri-anal circles of bristles. Each bristle, like those of Chaetopods, originates from a single
  cell.</p>

  <p>The anal vesicles arise quite late in the development; when they have acquired their openings
  into the body-cavity, they seem to take in water. In <i>Thalassema</i>, as described by Conn, this
  is accompanied by remarkable changes, amounting almost to a metamorphosis. The body increases in
  bulk fourfold, the cilia of the prae-oral ring disappear, and the animal now moves only by means
  of its proboscis; the pigment is absorbed, and all traces of segmentation disappear. A similar
  intaking of water is described by Spengel in <i>Bonellia</i>. In this genus the larva, which is
  coloured bright green, and has two brown eye-spots, is not such a typical Trochosphere as is that
  of <i>Echiurus</i> and <i>Thalassema</i>.</p>

  bearing spines. Two or three (<i>E. chilensis</i>) pairs of nephridia, their external orifice
  often lengthened and spirally coiled. Both sexes alike.</p>

  <p>Greef<a id="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> mentions six species of
  <i>Echiurus</i>, viz. <i>E. pallasii</i>, <i>E. forcipatus</i>, <i>E. sitchaensis</i>, <i>E.

  <i>E. unicinctus</i>. It seems probable that <i>E. forcipatus</i> of Reinhardt is identical with
  <i>E. pallasii</i>, although bigger, whilst <i>E. sitchaensis</i>, <i>E. carabaicus</i>, and <i>E.

  <p>Greef mentions eight species of <i>Thalassema</i> and Rietsch thirteen; three of these,
  however, <i>Th. grohmanni</i>, <i>Th. lessonii</i>, and <i>Th. pelzelnii</i>, were not seen by
  either author, and their description is taken from Diesing. There is some reason for thinking that
  the two first-named species are identical with <i>Th. neptuni</i>. Conn has established a new
  species for the specimens whose embryology he worked out at Beaufort, Virginia, and Selenka
  described a new species from the Challenger material.</p>

  <p><i>Bonellia.</i>&mdash;Proboscis very extensible and bifurcated at the end. The body and
  proboscis are coloured a bright green. Two ventral hook-like bristles, but no peri-anal ring. A
  single nephridium. The above applies to the female; the males are degenerate, and live in the
  nephridium or pharynx of the female.</p>

  <p>Three (or four?) species of this genus are known.</p>

  above applies to the female; as in the genus <i>Bonellia</i>, the male is minute and parasitic. It
  has two well-marked hook-like bristles situated behind the genital pore.</p>

  <p>This genus was first described by Koren and Danielssen as <i>H. arctica</i>. Two specimens were
  afterwards described by Horst as <i>H. glacialis</i>. Later Lankester described two other
  specimens; he was the first to find the male in the pharynx of the female. He is of the opinion
  that all three descriptions apply to the same species, and for this the original name <i>H.

  <p><b>Habits of the Echiuroidea.</b>&mdash;As a rule the members of this group conceal their
  bodies in clefts and fissures of rocks and stones, keeping up communication with the outer world
  by means of their proboscis. Rietsch<a id="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> describes
  a specimen of <i>Bonellia minor</i>, which he placed in an aquarium, exploring with its <span
  class="pagenum" id="page443"><span class="smaller">{443}</span></span>proboscis the nature of the
  bottom; when the animal had found a convenient crevice, it fixed its proboscis in it by means of
  the bifurcated end, and by its contraction drew the body up, and entered the hole, proboscis
  first. It then turned round, and during this operation doubtless the ventral hooks came into play;
  and then stretching out its proboscis, it began to explore the neighbourhood. The proboscis is
  evidently very sensitive, and in addition to being a locomotor organ, it is also used for the
  prehension of food. If cut off near the mouth, the animal does not long survive, but if a
  considerable portion is left the scar heals, and the lost part is probably regenerated. In
  captivity the animals frequently change their place of residence.</p>

  <p>Eisig some years ago described the great extensibility of the proboscis of <i>B. viridis</i>
  when confined in the tanks of the Zoological Station at Naples. When contracted the proboscis was
  but a few inches long, but at times it was extended till it reached the length of 1&frac12; metre,
  shining through the water as a transparent green thread. The body of the <i>Bonellia</i> was
  hidden under stones, but the proboscis could be seen seizing between its two ends the bodies of
  certain Ascidians which covered the inside of the tank, tearing them off the walls, and conveying
  them to the mouth along its grooved ventral surface.</p>

  <p>The food of the Echiuroidea consists of organic matter, in the main of animal nature, but the
  group differs from the Sipunculoidea in not eating sand.</p>

  <p>Rietsch describes <i>Thalassema neptuni</i> as being more active in its movements and less
  sedentary than <i>B. minor</i>. The proboscis is still the chief organ of locomotion, but the
  trunk plays a greater part in the movements of the animal than it does in the last-named species.
  <i>Th. neptuni</i> is found in cavities of stones or in the chambers worn out by the Mollusc
  <i>Gastrochaena</i>; when withdrawn from its house the body is found to be covered by a thick
  layer of tenacious viscid mucus.</p>

  <p><i>Th. mellita</i> was so named by Conn because it is found sheltering in the Echinid
  <i>Mellita</i>. "It enters the shell at the oral opening while yet very small, but once within its
  house it grows to its adult size, and is obliged therefore to remain during the rest of its life a
  prisoner." Each shell thus inhabited acquires a reddish brown horse-shoe-shaped marking, which
  affords a conspicuous signal that the shell contains a <i>Thalassema</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Thalassema</i> is seldom found living in sand, and <i>Bonellia</i> never, but
  <i>Echiurus</i> is almost always found in <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped tubes or passages
  in the sand, which it digs out for itself by the rapid contractions of its body-wall aided by its
  bristles. It, like the other two genera named above, does not long remain in the same hole, but
  frequently changes its home. As a rule the <i>Echiurus</i> sits near the mouth of its tube, which
  is often a foot or even two in depth, and sends out its proboscis in every direction; at the least
  sign of disturbance it withdraws into the deeper recesses. The walls of the tube are kept from
  falling in by a layer of mucus, which makes a smooth lining to the passage. The peri-anal
  bristles, which can be withdrawn or protruded at will, enable the animal to fix itself at any
  level in the tube.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Echiuroidea are sometimes used by fishermen as bait. In <i>Echiurus
  pallasii</i> Greef found three parasites, all of them new species. One, a Gregarine, he named
  <i>Conorhynchus gibbosus</i>; the others were Platyhelminthes, and were named by him <i>Distomum
  echiuri</i> and <i>Nemertoscolex parasiticus</i> respectively.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>IV. Order Epithetosomatoidea.</b></p>

  <p>This Order includes the single Family <i>Epithetosomatidae</i>, which was established by Koren
  and Danielssen to contain the remarkable Gephyrean they described in 1881 under the name
  <i>Epithetosoma norvegicum</i> (Fig. 225).</p>

  <p>Unfortunately only two specimens were at their disposition, and these were badly preserved, so
  that many details of their structure could not be made out. The animals are of an olive-green
  colour, and consist of a trunk about 12 mm. long, and of a proboscis 30 mm. in length; the latter
  differs essentially from the proboscis of the Echiuroidea inasmuch as it is hollow, and seems to
  be a whip-like tubular extension of the skin. Its lumen opens into the body-cavity. Ventral to the
  base <span class="pagenum" id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>of the proboscis
  is the mouth; the intestine is straight, and terminates in the anus, which is posterior.  The
  nervous system lies between the circular and the longitudinal muscles of the body-wall, and
  contains a tube, the nature of which is obscure. No vascular system is known.  The ovary is
  attached to a mesentery ventral to the anterior part of the alimentary canal, and there is a
  single nephridium.  No anal vesicles exist.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable feature of the genus is a series of pore-like openings, which are stated to
  lead from the outside into the body-cavity (Fig. 225, <i>a</i>). These are arranged four on each
  side, at the bottom of two slit-like depressions in the skin, which lie one on each side of the
  base of the proboscis, slightly dorsal to it.</p>

  <p>These remarkable structures are without parallel amongst the Gephyrea, and, together with the
  peculiar character of the proboscis, justify the Norwegian naturalists in adding a new family to
  the group.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Affinities of the Gephyrea.</b></p>

  <p>Before considering to what other groups of animals the Gephyrea may be allied, it is advisable
  to discuss the relationship of the four Orders which compose the group.</p>

  <p>Quatrefages, in the year 1865, divided the Gephyrea into I. <i>Gephyrea Armata</i>, with which
  he included the Echiuroidea and <i>Sternaspis</i>,<a id="NtA_489"
  href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> and II. <i>Gephyrea Inermia</i> or Sipunculoidea. The Gephyrea
  Inermia, sometimes called the Achaeta, have been extended to include the Order Priapuloidea, and
  opposed to the smaller sub-group the Gephyrea Armata or Chaetifera. In my opinion, however, these
  names now are no longer in accordance with our knowledge of the structure of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page446"><span class="smaller">{446}</span></span>animals they attempt to
  describe, and they should be given up. Both names had reference to the presence or absence of the
  two hook-like bristles described on the ventral surface of some of the Echiuroidea, but of the
  five genera of this family, two, <i>Saccosoma</i> and <i>Hamingia</i> (the latter in the female or
  normal form), are without these bristles, and can therefore be described neither as <i>Armata</i>
  nor as <i>Chaetifera</i>. On the other hand, hook-like chitinous bristles of somewhat the same
  nature, though smaller in size and varying in position, are very common on the introvert of
  Sipunculoidea and on the body of the Priapuloidea.</p>

  <p>Again, the association of the two last-named Orders in one sub-group is, to my mind, an error.
  The Priapuloidea have little in common with the Sipunculoidea; almost the only real point of
  resemblance is the power of protruding the anterior part of the alimentary canal, and withdrawing
  it by the aid of retractor muscles. But in the Priapuloidea this power exists to a very small
  extent, and it is a power shared by very many animals besides the Gephyrea. The terminal anus of
  the former is a feature shared by the Echiuroidea and by <i>Epithetosoma</i>, but these have
  little else in common with the Priapuloidea. On the other hand, the entire absence of any head
  appendages, such as the proboscis of the Echiuroidea and the tentacles or tentacular membrane of
  the Sipunculoidea, the absence of a vascular system, of nephridia or anal vesicles, taken together
  with the straight intestine which occurs elsewhere only in <i>Epithetosoma</i>, the persistent
  connexion of the nervous system with the epidermis, the unique character of their excretory system
  and of the reproductive organs, are all features in which the Priapuloidea differ from the more
  normal members of the other three Orders. These constitute a list of peculiarities which are at
  least as important, and probably even more important, than those which characterise the
  Sipunculoidea and the Echiuroidea. Thus the Priapuloidea should, I think, be regarded as a
  distinct Order, which occupies a very isolated position in the group.</p>

  <p>Until we know something about the development of <i>Halicryptus</i> and of <i>Priapulus</i>, it
  will be difficult to say whether the Order is more nearly allied to one or the other of the two
  great Orders of Gephyrea, whether it is very primitive or very specialised. The connexion of the
  entire nervous system with the epidermis and the absence of a vascular system are both <span
  class="pagenum" id="page447"><span class="smaller">{447}</span></span>rather primitive features,
  and so is the Platyhelminthine character of the excretory organs. With regard to the vascular
  system, however, it should be pointed out that it arises very late in the larva of those Gephyrea
  whose development is known, and that it does not seem to correspond with the vascular system of
  other animals; it has no fine vessels or capillaries connected with it, and apparently does not
  act so much as the channel of the circulatory medium, but more as a mechanism for the expansion of
  the head appendages, the tentacles in the Sipunculoidea and the proboscis in the Echiuroidea;
  moreover, it is absent in some genera of the former, such as <i>Onchnesoma</i>, <i>Tylosoma</i>,
  and <i>Petalostoma</i>, where there are no tentacles.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of the whole matter seems to be that the Priapuloidea are an isolated Order
  retaining many primitive features, and having no closer affinities to the Sipunculoidea than to
  the Echiuroidea.</p>

  <p>Hatschek came to the conclusion, from his work on the development of <i>Echiurus</i>, that the
  Echiuroidea are true "Annelids," and from the presence and mode of formation of the bristles, that
  they are related to the Chaetopods. In this view he is confirmed by Conn, who worked out the
  development of <i>Thalassema</i>. This relationship is further confirmed by the discovery of
  Sluiter's that <i>Sternaspis</i>, the genus of Chaetopods which in other respects most nearly
  resembles the Gephyrea, has in one of its species (<i>S. spinosa</i>) a well-marked bifid
  proboscis, which, like that of the Echiuroidea, is thrown off at the least disturbance. Thus it
  seems fairly well established that the Echiuroidea are closely connected with the Chaetopoda, for
  although the only traces of segmentation they retain in the adult are the serially-repeated
  nephridia of <i>Thalassema</i> and <i>Echiurus pallasii</i>, and the two rows of peri-anal
  bristles in the latter, and possibly the circular nerves given off from the ventral cord, yet the
  larva is fully segmented, and in other respects is almost typically Chaetopodan.</p>

  <p>The relationship of the Sipunculoidea to the Echiuroidea is a more doubtful point. Hatschek is
  inclined to separate them, and in this he is again supported by Conn. Embryology unfortunately
  does not help us much. The early stages and larvae of <i>Sipunculus nudus</i> and of
  <i>Phascolosoma elongatum</i> have been investigated by Hatschek and by Selenka respectively. In
  neither genus is there any trace of segmentation or of Annelid <span class="pagenum"
  id="page448"><span class="smaller">{448}</span></span>features, with the possible exception of the
  bristles on the larval <i>Phascolosoma</i>. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the
  development of <i>Sipunculus</i> is remarkably abbreviated, and that such stages may have dropped
  out, the larvae hardly differing more from the Trochosphere of <i>Echiurus</i> and
  <i>Thalassema</i> than does that of <i>Bonellia</i>, an undoubted Echiurid. Still the facts that
  there is never a head-kidney present, that there is no trace of segmentation, and that at no stage
  is the anus terminal, must have a certain weight.</p>

  <p>If we leave out of account the larval history, which, although pointing to a difference in the
  nature of the two families, is by no means decisive, and consider the adult structures, we find
  very considerable evidences of affinity. Taking firstly the main points of difference, we find
  these to be (i.) the nature of the cephalic appendages, either a proboscis or some modification of
  tentacles; (ii.) the position of the anus; (iii.) the presence of anal vesicles; (iv.) the number
  of the nephridia, never more than one pair in Sipunculids; and (v.) the difference in origin of
  the chaetae. Of these most undoubtedly the first is the most important. The Echiuroidea have
  retained the prae-oral lobe of the larva in the form of a solid outgrowth of the body, which
  outgrowth has carried with it the nerve-ring and vascular ring which surround the mouth. This has
  been lost in the Sipunculoidea, but is, I think, represented by a modified patch of epidermis
  which lies dorsal to the mouth and just above the brain. A solid extension of the skin in this
  region, which involved the nervous and vascular systems, would bring about the same relation of
  parts as is found in the Echiuroidea. The tentacular membrane or tentacles of the Sipunculoidea
  have such a variety of form and arrangement, whilst all subserving the same end, that I am
  inclined to believe that they have originated within the limits of the family.</p>

  <p>The position of the anus in the Sipunculoidea is one common to very many animals which live
  embedded in sand or in tubular holes; it is probably not primitive, as in the larva of
  <i>Sipunculus</i> it is near the posterior end, and becomes more dorsal as the larva
  elongates.</p>

  <p>The anal vesicles of the Echiuroidea probably have no representative in the Sipunculoidea. In
  appearance and position they are very like the little tufts which are found on the rectum of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page449"><span class="smaller">{449}</span></span><i>Sipunculus</i>, but since
  these open neither into the body-cavity nor into the alimentary canal, it is hardly fair to
  compare them.</p>

  <p>The resemblances between the Orders seem to me, on the whole, to outweigh the differences. The
  general structure of the skin, the coiled alimentary canal, with its ciliated groove, supported by
  strands of muscles, the vascular system which gives off no capillaries, the structure of the brown
  tubes, the existence of chitinous hooks or bristles, the nervous system with its single
  unsegmented ventral cord, the formation of the generative organs, all point to a sufficiently
  close resemblance to justify us in classing the two Orders together. In addition to these there
  are considerable histological resemblances which cannot be discussed here, but which have a
  certain weight.</p>

  <p>To sum up, it seems probable that the Echiuroidea are derived from the Chaetopoda, and that
  their nearest ally in this group is <i>Sternaspis</i>; and that the Sipunculoidea are allied to
  the Echiuroidea, but have further departed from the Annelid stock, and have lost even those traces
  of affinity with the parent group which have been preserved in the development of <i>Echiurus</i>
  and <i>Thalassema</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">So little is known of <i>Epithetosoma</i> that it is difficult to discuss its
  affinities. The presence of the hollow proboscis and the pores leading into the body-cavity
  undoubtedly justify its being placed in a separate Order, but beyond the presence of a terminal
  anus, in which it resembles the Echiuroidea, there is nothing in its structure which connects it
  more nearly with one than with the other of the three larger Orders of Gephyrea.</p>

  <p>This interesting genus was discovered and first described by Dr. Strethill Wright of Edinburgh,
  who in the year 1856 found specimens of it living on a stone with <i>Caryophyllia</i> sent to him
  from Ilfracombe. He christened the form <i>Phoronis hippocrepia</i>,<a id="NtA_490"
  href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> the generic name being apparently taken from an epithet
  applied to Io, the specific name having reference to the beautiful horseshoe shape of its
  tentacular crown. Two years later a closely allied or identical form was described by Professor P.
  J. van Beneden under the name of <i>Crepina gracilis</i>.<a id="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Phoronis</i> is a sedentary animal living in "colonies," but each member of the colony is
  distinct, and has no organic connexion with the others, from which it is isolated by the presence
  of a tube in which it lives, and into which it can be completely withdrawn. The tube is formed
  from a secretion which probably has its origin from the anterior end of the body-wall. The
  secretion hardens and forms at first a transparent coating, but it soon becomes opaque, and
  numerous sand particles, small pieces of shell, sponge spicules, and other marine objects adhere
  to the outside of the tubes, giving them a very characteristic appearance, and doubtless serving

  <p>What little we know about the habits of <i>Phoronis</i> is in the main due to the observations
  of Cori,<a id="NtA_492" href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> who studied <i>Ph. psammophila</i> at
  Faro, an inlet of the sea near Messina. The least disturbance causes the animal to withdraw its
  head with lightning rapidity into the tube, from which after a time it re-emerges very slowly, and
  does not expand its tentacular crown until its body is completely extended. Cori states that not
  unfrequently individuals are found either without the crown of tentacles or with the latter in
  process of regeneration. These may have been bitten off by fish, etc.; but, on the other hand, van
  Beneden describes in <i>Crepina gracilis</i> (<i>Ph. hippocrepia</i>) the throwing off and
  regeneration of the crown of tentacles; and Cori confirms his observation, at any rate as far as
  concerns those individuals kept in captivity, and whose surroundings were presumably somewhat
  unfavourable. He further observed the interesting fact that the cast-off crown of tentacles
  continued to live, and suggests that possibly it may develop a new body, in which case the
  phenomenon would be an interesting case of binary fission producing two new animals.</p>

  <p>With regard to the habitation of <i>Ph. australis</i>, the largest species known, some
  discrepancies have crept into the literature of the genus, and to prevent their recurring again it
  may be worth while to quote the statements of its discoverer, Mr. Haswell.<a id="NtA_493"
  href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> He says: "<i>Phoronis australis</i> occurs in communities of
  twenty to thirty, in spaces in the substance of the wall of the tube inhabited and formed by a
  species of <i>Cerianthus</i>. Each worm has a tube of its own, very delicate and transparent, made
  up of several layers, the mouth opening on the outer surface of the tube of the <i>Cerianthus</i>.
  The <i>Cerianthus</i> tubes sometimes come up empty, as we should naturally expect, the animal
  having dropped out; but a sufficient number of <span class="pagenum" id="page452"><span
  class="smaller">{452}</span></span>occupied tubes are found to show that, under ordinary
  circumstances, a living <i>Cerianthus</i> occupies the interior of the tube and a community of
  <i>Phoronis</i> live in its wall. This species of <i>Phoronis</i> is never found anywhere else,
  and the species of <i>Cerianthus</i> is very rarely found without the <i>Phoronis</i>."</p>

  <p><i>Ph. australis</i> is sluggish in its movements, but other species are capable of very active
  movement, and withdraw their heads in a moment at the approach of danger. A Neapolitan species,
  <i>Ph. kowalevskii</i>&mdash;known to the fishermen of that place as "Ficchetelli bianchi" or
  "Vermi di ceppa"&mdash;lives chiefly on submarine posts and piles; its tubes, closely interlacing,
  form a dense feltwork, upon which Ascidians and Sea-anemones often settle, and over which
  Ophiurids and Polychaets creep. The tubes of this species are rendered opaque by the excreta
  ejected from the body, and they do not attach foreign substances to the outside to anything like
  the same degree as <i>Ph. psammophila</i>, which live in sandy places, and are termed by the
  Sicilian fishermen "Tubi di sabbia." The feltwork of <i>Ph. kowalevskii</i> attains a thickness of
  5 to 8 cm. In each case the tube is much longer than the animal it shelters, and is so entangled
  with its neighbours, to which it frequently adheres, that it is a matter of considerable
  difficulty to isolate it.</p>

  <p>The various species of <i>Phoronis</i> differ a good deal in size; Cori gives the average
  length as varying from 1.5 to 7.9 mm. in <i>Ph. hippocrepia</i> and up to 127 mm. (6 inches) in
  <i>Ph. australis</i>. Probably the very short individuals of the first-named species had not
  attained their adult stature. <i>Ph. australis</i> has recently formed the subject of a memoir by
  Dr. W. B. Benham,<a id="NtA_494" href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> from whom the following
  account is mainly taken.</p>

  <p>The length of the individuals varied from three to six inches, and their diameter, which is not
  very uniform, averaged one-eighth of an inch. At one end, which, since it bears the mouth, we may
  call the oral end, is the very characteristic tentacular <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span>crown surrounding the mouth on all sides but one, where there
  is a slight break in its continuity. The crown of tentacles or lophophore is flattened, and the
  two ends drawn out, and each is coiled into a spiral (Fig. 229); between the bases of these two
  spirals three ridges can be seen, each ending in a pore; the median opening is the anus, the two
  lateral are the openings of the nephridia or kidneys, which also serve as ducts for the
  reproductive organs. The anus is thus approximated to the mouth, and since the continuity of the
  tentacular crown is broken at a spot just between the two, there would be nothing to separate
  these orifices if it were not for the presence of the epistome, a projection or flap of the
  body-wall which overhangs the mouth between it and part of the crown of tentacles.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the ridge bearing the tentacles is incurved at each side varies in
  different species. In <i>Ph. kowalevskii</i> and <i>Ph. psammophila</i> the ends are only slightly
  turned in, so that the crown of tentacles is truly horse-shoe shaped; but in <i>Ph. australis</i>
  they are turned in and form three coils on each side. The number of tentacles also varies, being
  very numerous in <i>Ph. australis</i> and <i>Ph. buskii</i>&mdash;the latter having as many as
  300, whilst the other species as a rule have from 60 to 90. The bases of the tentacles are fused
  for a short distance with one another, forming a thin membrane.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      M&lsquo;Intosh.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The rest of each tentacle is free, and its inner surface, or that turned towards the mouth, is
  covered with long cilia, which, by the currents they set up, doubtless serve to bring food to the
  mouth. The tentacles are hollow, and their cavity is kept open by a stiffening of the tissue,
  which almost resembles an internal skeleton; the cavity communicates with the anterior part of the
  general body-cavity, and up it runs a single blood-vessel containing red blood. A single nerve is
  also distributed to each tentacle.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span></div>

  <p>At the base of the two spirals of the tentacular crown lie two ciliated pits, regarded by
  Caldwell and M&lsquo;Intosh<a id="NtA_495" href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a> as sensory organs,
  but Benham looks upon them as glandular in structure and function. Perhaps they secrete the
  substance from which the tubes are formed.</p>

  <p>The skin is covered by a delicate cuticle secreted by the underlying epidermis; within the
  latter is a well-marked basement membrane, and beneath this a layer of circular muscle fibres;
  these surround a layer of longitudinally-arranged fibres, which do not form a continuous sheet but
  are arranged in bundles. In both layers the fibres are unstriated. The longitudinal fibres are
  covered on their inner side by a layer of flat pavement cells, which line the general cavity of
  the body.</p>

  <p>This space, the body-cavity, is divided into two parts by the presence of a diaphragm or septum
  which runs across from one side of the body to the other about the level of the ridge bearing the
  tentacular crown. The anterior space is continuous with the cavities of the tentacles and of the
  epistome. The partition is pierced by the blood-vessels and the oesophagus, but the rest of the
  alimentary canal, including the anus, the kidneys, and the reproductive organs, all lie in the
  posterior half of the body-cavity behind the diaphragm. This portion of the body-cavity is further
  subdivided by the presence of three longitudinal mesenteries supporting the alimentary canal and
  running between it and the body-wall. One of these mesenteries runs along the outside of the
  alimentary canal throughout its whole length, attaching both the descending and ascending limbs of
  the <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped tube to the body-wall. The other two are lateral
  mesenteries, which pass from the body-wall to the sides of the oesophagus. These mesenteries
  therefore divide the body-cavity into three spaces&mdash;one in which the rectum lies, which may
  be called the rectal, and two lateral; owing to the fact that the lateral mesenteries end before
  they reach the bend of the alimentary canal, the three chambers are in free communication one with
  another. The body-cavity is further traversed by irregular strands of tissue which run from the
  body-wall to the various organs. It contains a corpusculated fluid.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal (Fig. 230) consists of a <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped tube <span
  class="pagenum" id="page455"><span class="smaller">{455}</span></span>which may be divided into
  four regions. The mouth (<i>m</i>) leads into the oesophagus (<i>oe</i>), which gradually enlarges
  into the stomach (<i>st</i>) situated just before the bend; a constriction just at the bend
  separates the stomach from the intestine (<i>int</i>), and this leads into the rectum (<i>r</i>),
  which terminates in the anus (<i>an</i>). The first three divisions of the alimentary canal are
  ciliated, but the rectum is not; the walls of the stomach also contain glandular cells, but there
  are no special glands opening into any part of the tract.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the most interesting features of <i>Phoronis</i> is the presence of a closed system of
  blood-vessels containing red blood. There are two main blood-vessels; one, lying in the rectal
  chamber between the two limbs of the <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped alimentary canal, has
  been named the afferent vessel. Just below the diaphragm this splits into two, and each branch,
  after piercing this partition, runs in a spiral course along the base of the crown of tentacles,
  giving off a single blood-vessel into each tentacle. At its base each tentacular vessel opens not
  only into the above-mentioned <span class="pagenum" id="page456"><span
  class="smaller">{456}</span></span>"distributing" vessel, but also into a "recipient" vessel which
  takes a course parallel with the former. The two recipient vessels pierce the diaphragm, and after
  running for some distance apart, fuse to form the efferent vessel, which continues down the body
  on the left side of the oesophagus. At the aboral end of the body the efferent vessel turns
  forward and becomes the afferent. Both the main vessels give off numerous blood diverticula, which
  are developed into plexiform sinuses on the walls of the stomach, and in this region they are
  covered with the reproductive cells. All the vessels are contractile, and Strethill Wright counted
  about fifteen pulsations a minute. The blood contains numerous nucleated, disc-shaped corpuscles
  differing in appearance from those of the fluid in the body-cavity. The corpuscles contain
  haemoglobin, which gives the red colour to the blood.</p>

  <p>The two nephridia or kidneys are essentially tubes which open on the one side into the
  body-cavity, and on the other to the exterior. The position of the external pores has already been
  described, one being on each side of the anus. Each pore leads into a tube which passes into that
  part of the body-cavity situated below the diaphragm, where it divides, and each of the two
  branches terminates in a ciliated funnel-shaped opening. The smaller of these two funnels pierces
  the lateral mesentery and opens into the lateral chamber, whilst the larger, whose opening is very
  much drawn out longitudinally, opens into the rectal chamber. The whole organ is ciliated
  internally.</p>

  <p>The nervous system lies in the skin immediately below the epidermis. This position is very
  primitive, and forms one of the most interesting anatomical peculiarities of the genus. The
  nervous tissue is probably diffused all over the body, but there is a special concentration or
  thickening in the form of a ring which surrounds the mouth, following the base of the tentacular
  spirals and giving off a nerve to each tentacle. The ring lies at the outside of the base of the
  tentacles, the anus is not included in it. Caldwell<a id="NtA_496"
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> has described in <i>Ph. kowalevskii</i> an asymmetrical
  nerve-cord given off from the ring and running along the left side of the body; associated with
  which is a tubular structure of unknown function. In <i>Ph. australis</i> Benham mentions two such
  tubes, one on each side of the body; their precise value is obscure.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page457"><span class="smaller">{457}</span></span></div>

  <p>The epithelium covering the nerve-ring is slightly modified in the neighbourhood of the kidney
  pore, and may have some special sensory function; no other organs of sense are known (but see p.
  <a href="#page454">454</a>).</p>

  <p><i>Phoronis</i> is hermaphrodite, male and female reproductive cells being formed in the same
  individual. The testes and ovaries form two white masses lying on the left side of the stomach,
  one on one side and the other on the other side of the efferent blood-vessel. The glands are
  traversed in all directions by the diverticula given off from this trunk, and are thus well
  supplied with blood; in fact both the ovary and the testis are formed by the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span>multiplication and growth of the epithelial
  cells which cover these diverticula. When ripe the ova and spermatozoa drop off into the

      part of the body of the adult.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The ova are probably fertilised in the sea-water; they undergo the early stages of their
  development whilst entangled amongst the tentacles of the parent. The larval form to which they
  give rise was known long before its connexion with the adult was demonstrated by Kowalevsky.<a
  id="NtA_497" href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> It is known as the Actinotrocha (Fig. 231, A),
  and according to Caldwell has the following structure in <i>Ph. kowalevskii</i>. The mouth is
  anterior, and the anus terminal and posterior; the mouth is overhung by an immense prae-oral lobe,
  which bears a special larval nerve <span class="pagenum" id="page459"><span
  class="smaller">{459}</span></span>ganglion, and in some species four eye-spots; at the base of
  this, but behind the mouth, is a ring of larval tentacles. The prae-oral lobe and the tentacles
  are ciliated; the margin of the lobe bears, however, specially long cilia, and there is also a
  ring of long cilia around the anus.</p>

  <p>Before the Actinotrocha stage has been reached the larva has forsaken the shelter of its
  parent's tentacles, and swims actively about in the open sea. As it grows older a finger-like
  involution of the skin (<i>c</i>) arises just behind the tentacles on the ventral surface and
  grows into the body, increasing greatly in length and becoming much folded. The larva now sinks to
  the bottom of the sea, and after swimming round many times on its axis, undergoes a very
  astonishing metamorphosis (Fig. 231, B, C). The finger-like involution is suddenly turned inside
  out, and forms a large projection on the ventral surface, into which the alimentary canal passes,
  assuming a <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shape, as in the adult. This ventral process in fact
  forms all the body of the adult behind the line of tentacles, and subsequently contains, not only
  the alimentary canal, but the kidneys, the reproductive organs, and a large part of the vascular
  system. At the same time the prae-oral lobe breaks off, and, together with its ganglia and
  eye-spots, passes into the mouth and is digested in the stomach; the larval tentacles follow the
  prae-oral lobe, and are similarly digested. Their place is taken by a ring of adult tentacles
  which commence to appear just behind the larval tentacles before they fall off. The animal is now
  practically adult.<a id="NtA_498" href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is obvious that this astonishing metamorphosis is accompanied by the rotation of the axes of
  the animal. The adult practically lives at right angles to the larva. In the latter the anus
  marked the posterior end, and the prae-oral lobe the anterior. The prae-oral lobe has disappeared
  in the adult, but its position is marked by the mouth. The ventral surface has enormously
  increased, and corresponds with the whole surface of the trunk. To be consistent we must therefore
  regard the mouth of the <span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span
  class="smaller">{460}</span></span>adult as marking the anterior end of the animal, the anus the
  posterior. The short line between the mouth and anus across the centre of the tentacular crown
  marks the dorsal surface; and the line running all round the trunk from anus to mouth, the
  ventral. In fact, in its usual position in its tube <i>Phoronis</i> is lying on its ventral
  surface, its back faces upwards, and the anterior and posterior ends lie on one side or the
  other.</p>

  <p><b>Species and Affinities.</b>&mdash;In his exhaustive memoir on the anatomy and histology of
  <i>Phoronis</i>, Cori enumerates seven different species, and quotes the characters of each as
  enumerated by eight different authors. He, however, reserves his opinion as to the identity or
  distinctness of some of these species. Benham in his account of <i>Ph. australis</i> enumerates
  five species, including amongst them <i>Ph. ovalis</i>, which, however, he regards as probably a
  young form, an opinion in which Cori coincides. The latter regards it as possibly a young form of
  <i>Ph. hippocrepia</i>.</p>

  <p>Without comparing specimens of each of the alleged species, it is difficult to come to any very
  satisfactory solution of the problem of how many distinct species are at present known, but it
  seems probable that there are at least six.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>(i.) <i>Phoronis hippocrepia</i> Wright.&mdash;Under this name is included the first form,
    described and named by Wright in 1856; also <i>Ph. ovalis</i>, described two years later by the
    same observer as a distinct form, though it now seems probable that it is but a young form of
    <i>Ph. hippocrepia</i>. The <i>Crepina gracilis</i> of van Beneden is probably identical with
    this species.</p>
    <p>This species occurs in membranous tubes embedded in limestone, corals, or oyster shells. Its
    length varies from 1.5 to 15 mm. The number of tentacles varies from 16 to 86. It has been found
    off the coast of Devonshire and in the Firth of Forth.</p>
    <p>(ii.) <i>Phoronis kowalevskii</i> Caldwell.&mdash;This name is given by Benham to the species
    from Naples described by Caldwell, and replaces the name <i>Ph. caespitosa</i>, which was given
    by Cori. This species is found in the Bay of Naples, living in considerable colonies on
    submarine piles and posts. It is not firmly attached to its substratum. The tube may be coated
    with sand or other foreign particles. The length of the individuals varies from 3 to 39 mm. The
    lophophore is simple, with from 50 to 100 tentacles.</p>
    <p>(iii.) <i>Phoronis australis</i> Haswell.&mdash;This is the giant of the genus, the length of
    the individuals being from 3 to 5 (76-127 mm.) or rarely 6 inches. It lives in delicate
    transparent tubes, interlacing the walls of the tube of a sea-anemone, <i>Cerianthus</i>. The
    arms of the lophophore coil into two spirals. The colour is reddish or purple. Found in Port
    Jackson.</p>
    <p>(iv.) <i>Phoronis buskii</i> M&lsquo;Intosh.&mdash;This species was dredged by the
    <i>Challenger</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page461"><span
    class="smaller">{461}</span></span>from a sandy bottom at a depth of 10 to 20 fathoms off the
    Philippines. Its tube is covered with particles of sand, sponge spicules, etc. Its length is 52
    mm. or more (more than two inches). The anatomy of this species closely resembles that of <i>Ph.
    australis</i>, and Benham thinks that, in spite of the difference in their habitat, they may
    belong to the same species.</p>
    <p>(v.) <i>Phoronis architecta</i> Andrews.&mdash;A species recently described by Andrews from
    Beaufort, N.C. Its distinctive features are: "the formation of isolated tubes covered by
    definite collections of sand grains; the presence of special prostomial organs, possibly of use
    in the formation of these tubes; the great development of the longitudinal muscles; the presence
    of a ciliated groove in the digestive tract; the apparent separation of the sexes."</p>
    <p>(vi.) <i>Phoronis psammophila</i> Cori.&mdash;Found in Faro, near Messina. The tube is
    hyaline, and is covered by numerous grains of sand, some of considerable size. The length of the
    individuals is 25 to 50 mm. There are 60 to 90 tentacles. The colour is a fleshy red. A second
    species discovered by Haswell in Port Jackson had no points of importance to distinguish it from
    <i>Ph. psammophila</i>, except that no sand adheres to its tube and the number of tentacles is
    slightly greater.</p>
    <p class="sp0">In addition to the various species of <i>Phoronis</i>, several distinct forms of
    its larva, Actinotrocha, are known, and have been named without having been traced into their
    corresponding adult form.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The position of <i>Phoronis</i> in the animal kingdom has formed the matter of considerable
  divergence of opinion amongst the naturalists who have studied it. The earlier writers regarded
  <i>Phoronis</i> as allied to the Gephyrea, and it was for a long time classed with these animals,
  but placed in a separate sub-Order, the <i>Gephyrea tubicola</i>, which was opposed to the
  <i>Gephyrea nuda</i>, which comprised the true Gephyrea.</p>

  <p>Caldwell referred <i>Phoronis</i>, the Brachiopoda, the Polyzoa, and the Gephyrea to the same
  type of body structure, and Lankester subsequently suggested the provisional name Podaxonia for
  this miscellaneous collection of animals. Lankester divided his phylum Podaxonia into three
  classes: (i.) the Sipunculoidea (Gephyrea), (ii.) the Brachiopoda, and (iii.) the Polyzoa. The
  last-named class he divided into three sections: (<i>a</i>) the Vermiformia, this includes the
  single genus <i>Phoronis</i>; (<i>b</i>) the Pterobranchia, including the forms
  <i>Cephalodiscus</i> and <i>Rhabdopleura</i>, whose affinities with Balanoglossus were
  subsequently demonstrated; and (<i>c</i>) the Eupolyzoa, including the forms treated as Polyzoa in
  the following pages.</p>

  <p>Masterman's recent researches<a id="NtA_499" href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> on
  <i>Phoronis</i> seem to indicate <span class="pagenum" id="page462"><span
  class="smaller">{462}</span></span>that the Vermiformia, like the Pterobranchia, must in future be
  grouped with the Hemichordata. He finds three well-defined coelomic spaces corresponding with the
  epistome, the collar, and the trunk, and also representatives of the collar pores, and is further
  inclined to believe that structures representing the notochord exist in Actinotrocha.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Should Masterman's researches be confirmed, <i>Phoronis</i> will be removed from
  its present isolated and enigmatical position, and placed with <i>Cephalodiscus</i> and
  <i>Rhabdopleura</i> amongst the Hemichordata, which will be described in Vol. VII. of this
  work.</p>

  <p>The following pages<a id="NtA_500" href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> deal with animals whose
  very existence is hardly known to those who are not professed naturalists. There are but few
  Polyzoa which have earned the distinction of possessing a popular name, and most of such names as
  do exist cannot be found outside treatises on Natural History. It is true that many of the members
  of this group have been vaguely termed "Zoophytes"; but this term implies no more than that they
  possess a superficial resemblance to certain plants, and it must be remembered that this habit of
  growth is assumed by many animals which have nothing to do with the Polyzoa. The term "Coralline"
  is sometimes applied to those calcareous Polyzoa which grow into coral-like forms; and the
  Tertiary deposit known as the "Coralline Crag" is so called from the large number of fossil
  Polyzoa which it contains.</p>

  <p>The Polyzoa are none the less a most attractive group. Let any one examine a dry piece of a
  brown paper-like substance (Fig. 232, A), which may be found thrown up on the beach on many parts
  of our coasts. Of this species (<i>Flustra foliacea</i>), the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span>so-called "sea-mat," an old writer says:
  "For curiosity and beauty, I have not, among all the plants or vegetables I have yet observed,
  seen any one comparable to this seaweed."<a id="NtA_501" href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a>
  Viewed with the microscope, the frond is seen to consist of two layers, placed back to back, of
  oblong chambers, each of which is the dried body-wall of a single individual. The whole is
  obviously a <i>colony</i>, and to this fact the term Polyzoa refers.</p>

  <p>The chambers just noticed are termed "zooecia." Each is rounded at one end, near which is the
  "orifice," through which the tentacles of the living animal can be pushed out. Two short, stiff
  spines usually occur on each side of the orifice; and the symmetry of this forest of spines fully
  justifies the above-quoted remark.</p>

      <i>a</i>, avicularium with closed mouth, to the left of which are seen two avicularia with
      open months; <i>o</i>, ovicell, forming the upper part of a zooecium. Ovicells are seen on
      three consecutive zooecia. The operculum, which closes the orifice of the zooecium, is seen in
      different positions in the individuals figured.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The upper part of some of the zooecia is somewhat swollen, these swellings representing the
  conspicuous "ovicells" of many other genera. In the early part of the year each ovicell protects
  an orange-coloured egg or embryo, and the larvae are readily liberated if the fresh colony be
  placed in clean sea-water. "At least ten thousand" were hatched out in three hours from a colony
  placed in a glass by Sir John Dalyell.<a id="NtA_502" href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a> The
  larva swims freely in the water for a short time, and should it find a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page467"><span class="smaller">{467}</span></span>suitable resting-place, it fixes itself and
  forms the starting-point of a colony, the number of whose individuals is continually increased by
  the production of buds at the growing edge. The "avicularia" of this species will be alluded to
  later (see p. <a href="#page482">482</a>).</p>

  <p><i>F. foliacea</i> has long been known to possess in the fresh state a remarkable odour, which
  is described, according to the fancy of the observer, as a strong odour of fish, or as the smell
  of violets after a shower. Others have compared it to that of the orange or verbena, or to that of
  a mixture of roses and geranium.</p>

  <p><i>Flustrella hispida</i>, another of our commonest Polyzoa, which may be found between
  tide-marks on the stalks of <i>Fucus</i>, consists of a softish brown encrustation, about
  one-sixteenth of an inch thick, covered by numerous spines. If examined undisturbed in a
  rock-pool, or transferred to a glass of sea-water, the brown mass will be seen to become
  surrounded by a delicate bluish halo, which is about as thick as the encrusting mass itself, and
  consists of the tentacles of the numerous individuals of the colony. The microscope shows that
  each individual is provided with a circlet of some thirty or more long, delicate tentacles, which
  together form a graceful funnel (as in Fig. 233). At the bottom of the funnel is the mouth, to
  which Diatoms or other minute organic particles are conveyed by the cilia which fringe the
  tentacles. If the tentacles be touched with a needle, the whole funnel is retracted with great
  rapidity, and in this retracted condition we see no more than the body-walls of the animals. After
  an interval the tips of the tentacles are cautiously protruded; the tentacles are <i>gradually</i>
  pushed out, at first in a close bundle, but finally separating from one another to form the funnel
  which we have already noticed.</p>

  <p>There is hardly a more surprising spectacle in the whole animal kingdom than a living fragment
  of the genus <i>Bugula</i>. The colony grows in the shape of a small tree, whose height may amount
  to several inches; and is characterised, in many species, by a spiral arrangement of the branches,
  which makes the genus easy to recognise at first sight (Fig. 233, A). The stem and branches are
  composed of a single layer of zooecia, arranged two or more abreast. Each zooecium bears, on its
  outer side, a most singular body termed an avicularium, from its resemblance to a bird's head.
  Imagine a minute eagle's head attached by a short but flexible neck to the zooecium. Suppose
  further <span class="pagenum" id="page468"><span class="smaller">{468}</span></span>that this
  structure moves backwards and forwards in a deliberate but determined fashion, its lower jaw
  usually widely open so as to be nearly 180&deg; distant from its position when closed. Suppose that
  the lower jaw is moved by powerful muscles which can be distinctly seen inside the transparent
  head of the avicularium, and that every now and then it closes with a snap, seizing any
  unfortunate worm which may happen to be within reach with a grasp of iron. The above gives a very
  faint idea of the appearance of a living <i>Bugula</i> colony, with its hundreds of swaying
  avicularia, and with its tentacular funnels protruding from their zooecia, and withdrawing
  themselves capriciously from time to time.</p>

  <p><b>General Characters.</b>&mdash;The Polyzoa are colonies, leaf-like or tree-like in form, and
  often strongly resembling seaweeds, or forming encrustations on the surface of stones and
  water-plants, or taking on other shapes. The units of the colony are complete individuals (Fig.
  234). The zooecium or body-wall encloses a body-cavity, in which lies a digestive canal, with
  which are closely connected the central nervous system and the retractile, ciliated tentacles. The
  structures other than the zooecium constitute the "polypide." The mouth (<i>m</i>) leads into the
  ciliated pharynx (<i>ph</i>) which is followed by the oesophagus (<i>oe</i>) which again passes
  into the stomach (<i>s</i>), whose walls are coloured by a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page469"><span class="smaller">{469}</span></span>characteristic yellowish pigment. The
  stomach gives off the intestine (<i>in</i>), which is lined by strong cilia, by means of which a
  rotatory movement is given to the faeces contained in it. This communicates by a narrow passage
  with the rectum (<i>r</i>), which opens by means of the anus (<i>a</i>).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the retracted condition the tentacles (<i>tn</i>) lie in a cavity <span class="pagenum"
  id="page470"><span class="smaller">{470}</span></span>which opens to the exterior by the orifice
  (<i>o</i>). The cavity is bounded by a thin membrane termed the "tentacle-sheath" (<i>ts</i>), and
  it is incompletely subdivided, near its upper end, by a diaphragm (<i>d</i>), perforated by a
  circular hole through which the tentacles can be protruded. The diaphragm bears the thin folded
  collar characteristic of the Ctenostomata, the group to which the species figured belongs (see p.
  <a href="#page477">477</a>).</p>

  <p>Fig. 238, B, shows the tentacles of <i>Bowerbankia</i> in their fully expanded and partially
  expanded condition. Comparing this with Fig. 234, it will be clear that when protrusion is taking
  place, the tentacles are forced in a bundle, tips first, through the diaphragm and next through
  the orifice of the zooecium, the alimentary canal offering no resistance to this movement, owing
  to the length of the oesophagus. A moment's consideration will show that the bases of the
  tentacles, in passing through the orifice, will carry with them that part of the flexible
  tentacle-sheath to which they are attached; and it will further be clear that so much of the
  tentacle-sheath as is thus protruded will be turned inside out. This process of "evagination"
  continues until its further progress is stopped by the retractor-muscles (<i>r.m</i>), and by the
  parieto-vaginal muscles (<i>p.v</i>), which pass from the interior of the body-wall to the upper
  part of the tentacle-sheath. The latter has now become the delicate layer which connects the
  expanded tentacles with the zooecium; and the anus (Fig. 238, C, <i>a</i>) opens directly to the
  exterior. Since the name "tentacle-sheath" is thus descriptive of the condition of retraction
  only, the term "kamptoderm"<a id="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> has been suggested
  as an alternative name.</p>

  <p>The presence of a complete digestive canal and the ciliation of the tentacles in Polyzoa are
  conspicuous differences between these animals and the Hydroids, with some of which the Polyzoa may
  have a marked external similarity.</p>

  <p>The outermost<a id="NtA_505" href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a> layer of the body-wall is
  known as the "ectocyst" (Fig. 234, <i>e</i>). This may be densely calcareous, in which case the
  dried Polyzoon differs little in appearance from the living animal with its tentacles retracted;
  or it may be partially calcified, or it may consist entirely of a flexible cuticle, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span>as in Fig. 234. The ectocyst
  is prolonged through the orifice (<i>o</i>) as far as the diaphragm (<i>d</i>).</p>

  <p>Forms with a calcareous ectocyst are commonly ornamented with ridges or other patterns, which
  are often of great beauty. The ectocyst in these cases is commonly interrupted at intervals by
  pores (Fig. 239, C), into which processes of the "endocyst"&mdash;the living, internal part of the
  body-wall&mdash;extend. These may appear as superficial pores, which apparently open to the
  exterior in the dried condition, or they may perforate the septa between adjacent individuals.
  This may be strikingly demonstrated by decalcifying a branch of <i>Crisia</i> (Fig. 237), in which
  the zooecia then appear connected by numerous strands of tissue. In many marine forms the
  communications between the individuals are in the form of small sieve-like plates known as
  "rosette-plates."</p>

  <p>The endocyst may consist of definite layers of ectoderm (<i>em</i>) and mesoderm (<i>mm</i>),
  as in Fig. 234, but the mesoderm is commonly in the form of a loose network, some of which is
  attached to the body-wall, some to the alimentary canal, some forming connecting strands between
  these two layers, and other cells floating about freely in the body-cavity. These mesodermic
  structures are often spoken of as the "funicular tissue," since one or more strands of it commonly
  take on the form of a definite "funiculus" (<i>f</i>). This structure may bear the ovary
  (<i>ov</i>), while the testes (<i>t</i>) are found, commonly in the same zooecium, attached to
  various parts of the body-wall. The eggs and spermatozoa, when ripe, break off and float freely in
  the body-cavity.</p>

  <p>The funicular tissue was at one time described as a "colonial nervous system." The idea
  expressed by this term must be considered erroneous from the fact that no nervous co-ordination of
  the individuals is known to exist, in the vast majority of cases. The actual nervous system
  consists of a ganglion (<i>g</i>) placed between the mouth and anus of each polypide, and lying in
  a small circular canal (not shown in Fig. 234) which immediately surrounds the oesophagus. This
  canal is developed in the bud as a part of the body-cavity, from which it becomes completely
  separated in marine forms. The Polyzoa have no vascular system.</p>

  <p><b>Brown Bodies.</b>&mdash;In the majority of cases, an extraordinary process of regeneration
  takes place periodically during the life of each zooecium. The tentacles, alimentary canal, and
  nervous system break down, and the tentacles cease to be capable of being <span class="pagenum"
  id="page472"><span class="smaller">{472}</span></span>protruded (Fig. 235, 1). The degenerating
  organs become compacted into a rounded mass (Fig. 235, 2 and 3, <i>b.b</i>), known from its colour
  as the "brown body." This structure may readily be seen in a large proportion of the zooecia of
  transparent species. In active parts of the colony the body-wall next develops an internal
  bud-like structure (Fig. 235, 1, <i>b</i>), which rapidly acquires the form of a new polypide
  (Fig. 235, 2 and 3). This takes the place originally occupied by the old polypide, while the
  latter may either remain in the zooecium in the permanent form of a "brown body," or pass to the
  exterior. In <i>Flustra</i> the young polypide-bud becomes connected with the "brown body" by a
  funiculus (Fig. 235, 1, 2). The apex of the blind pouch or "caecum" of the young stomach is guided
  by this strand to the "brown body," which it partially surrounds (3). The "brown body" then breaks
  up, and its fragments pass into the cavity of the stomach, from which they reach the exterior by
  means of the anus.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is some reason to believe<a id="NtA_507" href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> that these
  remarkable processes are connected with the removal of waste nitrogenous matters. The Marine
  Polyzoa are not known to be, in most cases, provided with definite excretory organs, although it
  is <span class="pagenum" id="page473"><span class="smaller">{473}</span></span>possible that the
  intertentacular organ (Fig. 234, <i>i</i>) described on p. <a href="#page508">508</a> may in some
  cases perform excretory functions. There can, however, be little doubt that some kind of excretion
  takes place in the Polyzoa; and in considering what organs could possibly perform this work, our
  attention is arrested by the alimentary canal. The digestive organs of the young bud are perfectly
  colourless. As growth proceeds, certain parts acquire a yellowish, and later a brown colour. The
  degeneration of the polypide is followed by the grouping of large numbers of the free cells of the
  body-cavity into a mass which closely surrounds the incipient "brown body." Under their action,
  the latter becomes considerably smaller, probably as the result of the absorption of matters of
  nutritive value into other tissues. The final result is the formation of the compact "brown body,"
  whose colour is principally derived from the pigment formerly present in the alimentary canal.
  Experiments made by introducing into the tissues of the Polyzoa certain artificial pigments which
  are known to be excreted by the <i>kidneys</i> when injected into the bodies of other animals,
  have given some reason for believing that the appearance of the brown pigment in the wall of the
  digestive organs is, in part, a normal process of excretion; although that process is not entirely
  carried out by the organs in question.</p>

  <p>Little is known with regard to the duration of life of a single polypide; but some information
  bearing on this question may be obtained from a set of observations made on <i>Flustra
  papyrea</i>.<a id="NtA_508" href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a> The table gives the number of days

  <p>These results did not hold good for all the zooecia in a single colony. In some, the "brown
  body" was not completely got rid of at the end of sixty-eight days, the conclusion of the
  experiment.</p>

  <p class="sp3">So striking are the facts relating to the "brown bodies" that it has been
  believed<a id="NtA_510" href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> that what we have above described as
  the individual really consists of two kinds of individuals: firstly, the "polypide" or complex of
  tentacles and digestive organs; and secondly, the "zooecium," or house of the zooid or polypide,
  corresponding with what has been described above as the body-wall. The one individual, the
  zooecium, is on this view provided with successive generations of the second kind of individual,
  the polypide; and these latter function as the digestive organs of the two-fold organism. This
  view, though fascinating at first sight, is not borne out by an examination of all the facts of
  the case, especially when the Entoprocta are taken into account.</p>

  <p><b>History.</b>&mdash;The history of the Polyzoa, as far as 1856, has been fully treated by
  Allman in his great work on the Fresh-water Polyzoa;<a id="NtA_511"
  href="#Nt_511"><sup>[511]</sup></a> but a few words may be said on this subject.</p>

  <p>The Polyzoa attracted comparatively little attention before the beginning of the present
  century. Originally passed over as seaweeds, their real nature was established in connexion with
  the discovery of the animal nature of corals. So great a revolution could hardly be accepted
  without a struggle, and even Linnaeus went no further in this direction than to place them in a
  kind of half-way group of "zoophytes," whose nature was partly animal and partly vegetable. It is
  hardly necessary to point out that this view has now been abandoned by common consent; and indeed
  there is no more reason for regarding an animal as showing an approach to the plants because it
  grows in the external semblance of a seaweed than there would be for supposing a bee-orchid to be
  allied to the animal kingdom because of the form of its flowers.</p>

  <p>But the claims of the Polyzoa to rank as a separate class were by no means admitted with the
  discovery that they were animals. They were still confounded with Hydroids, Alcyonarians, or
  Corals until their possession of a complete alimentary canal was recognised as a feature
  distinguishing them from those <span class="pagenum" id="page475"><span
  class="smaller">{475}</span></span>animals. This was principally due to the observations of J. V.
  Thompson<a id="NtA_512" href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a> in Ireland, who introduced the term
  <span class="sc">Polyzoa</span>; and of C. G. Ehrenberg<a id="NtA_513"
  href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> in Germany, who proposed the class-name <span
  class="sc">Bryozoa</span>, or moss-like animals.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to avoid all mention of the controversy which has raged with regard to these
  two rival terms. The controversy is for the present at rest, the name Polyzoa being employed by
  the majority of English writers, amongst whom must be mentioned Allman, Busk, Hincks, and Norman,
  admittedly authorities of the first rank; while Bryozoa is employed by practically all the
  Continental writers.</p>

  <p>The priority of Thompson's name is unquestioned. While Ehrenberg, however, definitely
  introduced Bryozoa <i>as the name of a group</i>, Thompson was less precise in this respect,
  although he states<a id="NtA_514" href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a> that his discovery "must be
  the cause of extensive alterations and dismemberments in the class with which they [the Polyzoa]
  have hitherto been associated." Thompson, in fact, clearly understood that the Polyzoa could no
  longer rank with the Hydroids. The controversy has been summarised by Hincks, in his <i>History of
  the British Marine Polyzoa</i>,<a id="NtA_515" href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a> where
  references to other papers on the same subject are given.</p>

  <p>The Polyzoa were associated by H. Milne-Edwards with the Tunicata in the group Molluscoidea
  (Mollusco&iuml;des<a id="NtA_516" href="#Nt_516"><sup>[516]</sup></a>), to which the Brachiopoda were
  afterwards added by Huxley.<a id="NtA_517" href="#Nt_517"><sup>[517]</sup></a> A knowledge of the
  development of the Tunicata has, however, shown that these animals must be withdrawn from any
  association with the other two groups; while there is little real evidence that even the
  Brachiopods have anything to do with the Polyzoa.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The Polyzoa are divided into two sub-classes:&mdash;I, the <span
  class="sc">Entoprocta</span>; and II, the <span class="sc">Ectoprocta</span>.<a id="NtA_518"
  href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> Although the character referred to by these terms is merely
  the position of the anus with relation to the tentacles,<a id="NtA_519"
  href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a> there can be no doubt that the two groups differ widely from

  important respects. I do not, however, accept the view, maintained by some authors, that the
  Entoprocta and the Ectoprocta are two separate classes which are not nearly related.</p>

  <p>The base from which the whole set of tentacles springs is known as the "lophophore."<a
  id="NtA_520" href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> In the Entoprocta (Fig. 236, 1) the lophophore is
  circular; the mouth is situated near the margin of the area surrounded by the tentacles; and the
  anus is found <i>within</i> the circlet, near the end opposite to the mouth.</p>

  <p>In (2) and (3), representing the Ectoprocta, the anus is <i>outside</i> the series of
  tentacles. In the majority of cases, including all the marine Ectoprocta and one or two of the
  fresh-water forms, the lophophore is circular (2), the mouth occurring at the centre of the
  circle, and not being provided with a lip. These forms of Ectoprocta constitute the Order <span
  class="sc">Gymnolaemata</span>,<a id="NtA_521" href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a> the dominant
  group of the Polyzoa in respect of number of genera and species. The remaining Ectoprocta belong
  to the exclusively fresh-water Order <span class="sc">Phylactolaemata</span>,<a id="NtA_522"
  href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> in which the mouth is protected by an overhanging lip or
  "epistome"; the ground-plan of the tentacles is, except in <i>Fredericella</i>, horse-shoe shaped
  (Fig. 236, 3), and the tentacles themselves are usually much more numerous than in the other
  cases.</p>

  <p>The general characters of these divisions will be more easily understood by referring to the
  figures given of living representatives of the groups. The Entoprocta are illustrated by Figs.
  243-245; the Gymnolaemata by Figs. 238, 240; and the Phylactolaemata by Figs. 247, 248.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page477"><span class="smaller">{477}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Gymnolaemata include three Sub-Orders:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp3">
    <p>1. <span class="sc">Cyclostomata.</span><a id="NtA_523"
    href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a>&mdash;Body-wall densely calcareous, the zooecia being more
    or less tubular, usually with a <i>circular</i> orifice (Fig. 237).</p>
    <p>2. <span class="sc">Cheilostomata.</span><a id="NtA_524"
    href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a>&mdash;Body-wall of varying consistency. The orifice is
    closed, in the retracted state of the polypide, by a chitinous <i>lip</i> or "operculum," which
    is more or less semicircular (Figs. 239, 241).</p>
    <p class="sp0">3. <span class="sc">Ctenostomata.</span><a id="NtA_525"
    href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a>&mdash;Body-wall always soft. The cavity into which the
    tentacles are retracted is closed by a frill-like membrane, the edges of whose folds have some
    resemblance to the teeth of a <i>comb.</i> This membrane, the "collar," is seen in different
    conditions of protrusion or retraction in Figs. 234, 238. The stomach may, in this group, be
    preceded by a muscular gizzard (Fig. 238, C, <i>g</i>).</p>
  </div>

  <p><b>Occurrence.</b>&mdash;By far the larger number of the Polyzoa are inhabitants of the sea. A
  recently published catalogue<a id="NtA_526" href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a> of marine Polyzoa
  includes nearly 1700 living species; and of these, the great majority belong to the Gymnolaemata.
  This group is further known to include an enormous number of fossil forms. Not only do we find
  that in living Polyzoa the members of a single Order largely outnumber the remainder of the
  Polyzoa, but we may further notice that the Cheilostomata, one of the sub-Orders of the dominant
  group, are at present largely in excess of the whole of the rest of the Polyzoa taken
  together.</p>

  <p>Polyzoa may be collected with ease on almost any part of our coasts. The fronds of the
  "sea-mat" (<i>Flustra foliacea</i>) are thrown up by the waves in thousands in places where the
  bottom is shallow and sandy. The bases of the larger seaweeds growing on rocks between tide-marks
  are nearly always thickly covered with encrustations of <i>Flustrella hispida</i> or of species of
  <i>Alcyonidium</i>, in places where they are kept moist by being covered with a sufficiently thick
  layer of other algae. Rocks which are protected from the sun may be coated with calcareous
  Cheilostomes; and these are also found, in company with branching Polyzoa of various kinds, on the
  bases of the <i>Laminaria</i> thrown up by gales or exposed at spring tides. The graceful spirals
  of <i>Bugula turbinata</i> (Fig. 233, A) may be found hanging from the rocks at extreme low water;
  while colonies of <i>Scrupocellaria</i>, remarkable for their vibracula (see p. <a
  href="#page484">484</a>), are common in many places between tide-marks. Certain species affect the
  mouths of estuaries.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page478"><span class="smaller">{478}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Membranipora membranacea</i> commonly covers many square inches of the frond of
  <i>Laminaria</i> with its delicate lace-like encrustation. Nitsche<a id="NtA_527"
  href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a> has shown that this species has its calcareous matter
  deposited in plates, separated by intervals of uncalcified ectocyst. The effect of this
  arrangement is to make the colony flexible, and to enable it to adapt its shape to the movements
  of the <i>Laminaria</i>, which is swayed to and fro by the action of the waves. Many of the
  calcareous forms growing on <i>Laminaria</i> have no special arrangement of this kind, and they
  accordingly grow in colonies whose area is so small that the greatest movements to which the
  seaweed is liable are not sufficient to crack or break the colony.</p>

  <p>Many species show a decided, or even exclusive, preference for particular situations; as, for
  instance, species of <i>Triticella</i>, which are only found on certain Crustacea. Many encrusting
  forms prefer the inside of dead shells of <i>Pecten</i>, <i>Cyprina</i>, etc., to any other
  habitat. <i>Terebripora</i><a id="NtA_528" href="#Nt_528"><sup>[528]</sup></a> excavates tubular
  cavities in the substance of the shells of Molluscs. <i>Hypophorella</i><a id="NtA_529"
  href="#Nt_529"><sup>[529]</sup></a> inhabits passages which it forms in the walls of the tubes of
  the Polychaets, <i>Lanice</i> and <i>Chaetopterus</i>. <i>Lepralia foliacea</i>, one of the
  Cheilostomata, forms masses which may reach a circumference of several feet, simulating a small
  coral-reef. Its contorted plates are a regular museum of Polyzoa, so numerous are the species
  which delight to find shelter in the quiet interstices of the colony. The exquisite little
  colonies of <i>Crisia eburnea</i> are commonly found on red seaweeds, or on the branches of the
  Hydroid <i>Sertularia</i>.</p>

  <p>The Polyzoa are found at all depths, certain Cheilostomes having been recorded from 3000
  fathoms. The Cyclostomes dredged by the "Challenger" were all found in depths of 1600 fathoms or
  less, while the Ctenostomes are a distinctly shallow water group, most having been found at less
  than 40 fathoms, and only three at so great a depth as 150 fathoms.<a id="NtA_530"
  href="#Nt_530"><sup>[530]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">A few forms (<i>Membranipora pilosa</i>, <i>Scrupocellaria reptans</i>, etc.) are
  known to be phosphorescent;<a id="NtA_531" href="#Nt_531"><sup>[531]</sup></a> but it is not known
  what is the purpose of this phenomenon.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page479"><span class="smaller">{479}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>External Form.</b>&mdash;The Polyzoa may be roughly divided into (1) encrusting forms,
  usually calcareous, but sometimes soft; and (2) erect forms, which are either rigid or flexible.
  This flexibility can coexist with a highly calcified ectocyst, as in <i>Crisia</i> (Fig. 237),
  <i>Cellaria</i>, and others in which the branches are interrupted at intervals by chitinous
  joints. The coral-like forms may assume the most exquisite shapes, pre-eminent among which are the
  lovely net-like colonies of <i>Retepora</i>. Polyzoa of this type are seldom found between
  tide-marks, where their brittle branches would be liable to be snapped off by the waves. The
  <i>erect</i> species which occur in such positions are flexible, although flexible species are by
  no means restricted to the zone between tide-marks.</p>

  <p>Although the form of the colony is very different in different Polyzoa, a pocket-lens will
  usually show whether a given specimen belongs to the group or not. The surface is nearly always
  more or less distinctly composed of zooecia, or at least shows their orifices. The entire colony
  may be built up of these zooecia; and this is by far the commonest arrangement, both in encrusting
  and in erect forms. In certain genera, however, and particularly in some Ctenostomes (Fig. 238),
  and in most of the Entoprocta, the <span class="pagenum" id="page480"><span
  class="smaller">{480}</span></span>individuals grow out at intervals from a cylindrical stem or
  "stolon" (<i>st</i>), which is not composed of zooecia.</p>

  <p>The Cyclostomata may assume an erect or encrusting habit. Their zooecia are always more or less
  cylindrical; the upper ends being often completely free, although in many cases the whole zooecium
  is closely adnate to its neighbours. In the breeding season the forms which belong to this group
  are provided with curious "ovicells," which contain the embryos. These may either be pear-shaped
  swellings on the branches (<i>Crisia</i>, Fig. 237), or they may form inflations of the surface,
  between the zooecia. The mature ovicell is provided with one or more openings, through which the
  larvae escape.</p>

  <p>The Ctenostomata rarely have even the slightest trace of calcareous matter. <i>Alcyonidium</i>
  and its allies form soft encrustations, or may even grow into erect masses six inches or more in
  height (<i>A. gelatinosum</i>). In this type the zooecia are often so closely united that it may
  be difficult or impossible to make out their limits in the living colony. Many of the dendritic or
  branching <span class="pagenum" id="page481"><span class="smaller">{481}</span></span>Ctenostomes
  (Fig. 238) are characterised by an extreme delicacy of habit. The zooecia in these cases are
  sharply marked off from the stem. They are either cylindrical or ovoid, being commonly attached by
  a very narrow base, so that in some species they readily fall off, and may thus be completely
  absent in certain parts of the colony. In such forms as <i>Vesicularia spinosa</i>, it requires
  considerable experience to recognise a stem which has lost its zooecia as being part of a
  Polyzoon. In <i>Mimosella</i> the zooecia possess a remarkable power of movement on the stem,
  similar to that possessed by the leaflets of the Sensitive Plant.<a id="NtA_532"
  href="#Nt_532"><sup>[532]</sup></a> In certain forms (<i>Bowerbankia</i>, <i>Amathia</i>) the
  zooecia occur in groups separated by intervals which are devoid of zooecia, but in other cases
  they may have a more irregular arrangement. The collar to which this group owes its name is by no
  means a conspicuous feature. Its position when retracted has been shown in Fig. 234, while Fig.
  238 further illustrates its relations.</p>

  <p>The Cheilostomata grow in a great variety of forms, and also show a wide range of character in
  their zooecia. The orifice is commonly surrounded by stiff spines (Fig. 257, p. <a
  href="#page524">524</a>), which perhaps have the function of protecting the delicate polypides
  from the sudden impact of foreign bodies. These spines may attain an enormous development, as in
  <i>Bicellaria ciliata</i>, and some forms of <i>Electra</i> (<i>Membranipora</i>) <i>pilosa</i>
  (Fig. 256, A).</p>

  <p class="sp3">The operculum is usually, though by no means always, a conspicuous feature of the
  Cheilostome zooecium. It is invariably of chitinous consistency, and is more or less semicircular
  in outline, the straight edge forming a hinge on which the operculum opens. In some cases the
  orifice is surrounded by a raised margin or "peristome" (Fig. 255, B, C); the operculum is then
  situated at the bottom of a depression of the surface, and may be concealed from view. In others,
  in which the front wall of the zooecium is membranous (<i>Bugula</i>, Fig. 233), the operculum is
  merely a part of this membrane, and so is quite inconspicuous; and in cases of this kind the
  membranous wall may be protected by an arched spine, the "fornix," developed from one side of the
  zooecium (Fig. 254, <i>f</i>). The ovicells are commonly a conspicuous feature of this group,
  although they are believed to differ fundamentally from those of Cyclostomata. They have the form
  of a helmet-like covering overhanging the orifice (Figs. 240, 241), <span class="pagenum"
  id="page482"><span class="smaller">{482}</span></span>and may be either prominent or more or less
  concealed by the growth of adjacent parts of the zooecia. The presence of ovicells of this
  description is perfectly distinctive of the Cheilostomata.</p>

  <p><b>Avicularia and Vibracula.</b>&mdash;Most singular of the external appendages of the
  Cheilostomata are the extraordinary "avicularia" and "vibracula" of some genera.<a id="NtA_533"
  href="#Nt_533"><sup>[533]</sup></a> By the comparison of a carefully selected series of genera, it
  has been established that the avicularium is a special modification of a zooecium. One of its
  least modified forms is found in <i>Flustra foliacea</i> (Fig. 232), where the avicularia
  (<i>a</i>) are small zooecia with a conspicuously large operculum ("mandible"). Avicularia of a
  similar type occur in <i>Cellaria</i> (Fig. 239, A), <i>Schizotheca</i>, etc., the avicularium
  occupying the place of an ordinary zooecium. These are the "vicarious" avicularia of Mr. Busk.<a

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the next stage (Figs. 239, B, 256, B) the avicularian zooecium is further reduced; it has in
  most cases lost its place in the series of individuals, and is found instead seated on some part
  of an ordinary zooecium ("adventitious" avicularia). The avicularium now consists of a much
  reduced zooecium, bearing the well-developed operculum or mandible.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page483"><span class="smaller">{483}</span></span></div>

  <p>Having arrived at this point, the avicularia seem to lose all sense of the propriety of
  remaining in the positions once occupied by zooecia. They have become degraded to the rank of
  appendages of the zooecia, and as such they may occur in an astonishing variety of positions.
  Sometimes one occurs on each zooecium in the middle line, or asymmetrically, or even on the top of
  the ovicell; in other cases the orifice is flanked by an avicularium on each side (Fig. 239, B).
  Sometimes (<i>Cellepora</i>) the avicularia are of more than one kind, some being large and some
  small, some having a pointed mandible and others a mandible with a rounded spoon-like end.</p>

  <p>In the cases so far considered, the body of the avicularium is fixed. The highest
  differentiation acquired by these structures occurs in cases like <i>Bugula</i>, where they are
  borne on flexible stalks, which may even exceed the avicularia in length.<a id="NtA_535"
  href="#Nt_535"><sup>[535]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Bugula turbinata</i> (Fig. 240) each zooecium is provided with one of these appendages,
  attached to the base of the outer of the two spines which border its orifice. The avicularia of
  the two edges of the flattened branch are much larger than those of the more internal zooecia. The
  upper jaw is strengthened by a kind of buttress, or thickening of the ectocyst, which passes on
  each side across the avicularium to the hinge-line of its mandible. The upper part of the beak is
  strongly hooked, while the tip of the mandible bears a <span class="pagenum" id="page484"><span
  class="smaller">{484}</span></span>prominent spike, which fits inside the upper beak when the jaw
  snaps. A great part of the head is filled with a strong muscle, whose fibres exhibit a distinct
  transverse striation, and converge into a median tendon. The latter is inserted into the middle of
  the mandible. The muscle serves to close the jaws, and is the representative of the muscles by
  which the operculum is closed in an ordinary zooecium. The lower jaw is opened by means of a pair
  of muscles which are situated immediately under the ectocyst of the avicularium, and pass into the
  mandible close to its hinge.</p>

  <p>Within the jaws, in the region which we may term the palate, is a rounded knob, which bears a
  tuft of delicate sensory hairs, which doubtless enable the avicularium to recognise the presence
  of any foreign body. The closure of the mouth may, indeed, be instantaneously induced by touching
  it with the point of a needle. It has been suggested that a small mass of cells which bears these
  hairs may represent the rudiment of the polypide.</p>

  <p>The "vibraculum" (Fig. 242) is regarded as an avicularium in which the mandible has become
  elongated, so as to form a <span class="pagenum" id="page485"><span
  class="smaller">{485}</span></span>thin, chitinous "seta," which from time to time moves through
  the water. The part of the vibraculum which represents the zooecium commonly bears a tubular
  rootlet, used for attaching the colony to the substance on which it is growing (Fig. 254, p. <a
  href="#page517">517</a>).</p>

  <p>In <i>Microporella ciliata</i> (Fig. 241, A) the avicularia are very variable, and in some
  cases take on a "vibraculoid" character. But in the fully-developed vibraculum (Fig. 242) there is
  usually no such compromise of characters. It may, however, be noted that <i>Scrupocellaria
  scabra</i> (Fig. 254), which belongs to a genus characterised by its highly differentiated
  vibracula, possesses structures (<i>v.z</i>) which could hardly be distinguished from avicularia
  were it not for the presence of the rootlet (<i>r</i>).</p>

  <p>In the course of some observations which I had the opportunity of making on <i>Bugula
  calathus</i> at Naples, a fine hair offered to a small colony was seized with such force by the
  avicularia that the entire colony was lifted out of the water by the hair. The same colony had
  captured (1) a small <i>Nereis</i>, which it held with several of its avicularia; (2) an Anisopod
  Crustacean, 2&frac12; mm. long; and (3) a small Amphipod, which was held by one of its antennae. The
  Anisopod was held by the tip of one leg with one avicularium, and by the penultimate joint of one
  of its chelae with an avicularium of another branch. It was captured in such a way that its chela,
  the "hand" of which was about half as long as the avicularium, actually closed on to the
  avicularium without being able to effect its escape. A little later the other chela was caught by
  another avicularium. Curiously enough, however, an avicularium did not necessarily close even when
  part of a captured animal was actually in its mouth. The avicularia made no attempt to place
  themselves in an advantageous position for catching fresh parts of the <i>Nereis</i>, which they
  might easily have done. The avicularia which had captured prey remained motionless. The others
  moved backwards and forwards (cf. the various positions of the avicularia shown in Fig. 240) ten
  times in &frac34; to 1 minute, snapping their jaws perhaps once in that time. The two Crustacea were
  still retained by the avicularia two days later. On the next day they had both disappeared; but
  the colony had again caught the <i>Nereis</i>, which had previously effected its escape with the
  loss of nearly all its tentacular cirri.</p>

  <p>These observations, and others which have been recorded, do not, unfortunately, give any
  information as to the purpose of the <span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span
  class="smaller">{486}</span></span>movements of the avicularia and vibracula.  It is obvious that
  they may be defensive in character; and it cannot be doubted that the avicularia can prevent
  inquisitive worms from straying at will over the surface of the colony. There is no evidence to
  show that animals are discouraged from interfering with a <i>Bugula</i> owing to the presence of
  its defensive weapons.</p>

  <p>It is not, indeed, certain what are the enemies against which the Polyzoa have specially to
  guard. Sea-urchins and certain Molluscs are known to browse on Polyzoa. Fresh-water Polyzoa, in
  which avicularia and vibracula are absent, are attacked by the larvae of Insects, and by Triclad
  Planarians. I have found the latter with their long pharynx everted and completely buried in a
  <i>Cristatella</i> colony. It is possible that some marine Cheilostomes may be saved from attacks
  of this kind owing to the existence of their armoury of avicularia and vibracula. It is also
  possible that these structures are of service by removing foreign particles which might otherwise
  settle on the colony, and tend to block up its orifices. It has further been suggested that
  animals seized by the avicularia may be held until they die, and that their disintegrating
  particles may then be carried to the mouths of the polypides by the ciliary currents of the
  tentacles; but proofs of this suggestion are <span class="pagenum" id="page487"><span
  class="smaller">{487}</span></span>wanting, and it must be admitted that the subject needs further
  elucidation.</p>

  <p>The vibracula ordinarily remain stationary for some little time, every now and then giving a
  sweep through the water. In the majority of cases these structures, like the avicularia, act
  perfectly independently of one another, so far as can be made out; but in <i>Caberea</i> (Fig.
  242) the vibracula move in unison, the simultaneous action of the whole series, after a period of
  quiet, being described as "positively startling."<a id="NtA_536"
  href="#Nt_536"><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It has been stated by Busk<a id="NtA_537" href="#Nt_537"><sup>[537]</sup></a> that the entire
  colony in <i>Selenaria</i> and <i>Lunulites</i> may be moved from place to place by the large
  vibracula which these forms possess.</p>

      beginning of a new polypide-bud; in 4 the primary calyx has been lost, and the new calyx is
      clearly marked off from the stalk.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Entoprocta.</b>&mdash;The Entoprocta, although a very small sub-class, deserve special
  consideration, if for no other reason, from the fact that many writers regard them as the most
  primitive group of Polyzoa, and consequently as the forms which show most affinity to other
  classes of animals.</p>

  <p>Their most obvious characteristic is, as we have already seen,<a id="NtA_538"
  href="#Nt_538"><sup>[538]</sup></a> the position of the anus within the circle of tentacles. The
  individuals formed by budding always remain more separate from one another than those of most
  Ectoprocta.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page488"><span class="smaller">{488}</span></span></div>

  <p>The commonest Entoproctous genus is <i>Pedicellina</i>, a graceful little animal, which occurs
  on many parts of our coast. It may often be discovered by looking carefully on the pink, jointed,
  calcareous alga, <i>Corallina</i>, which may be found growing at the edges of deep and cool
  rock-pools not too far above low-water mark. Its creeping stem or "stolon" is firmly attached to
  the surface of the seaweed, and sends off vertical stems here and there.<a id="NtA_539"
  href="#Nt_539"><sup>[539]</sup></a> Each stem bears a "calyx," which is practically an individual
  of the colony. The stolon terminates, at one or both ends, in a growing-point (<i>a</i>), from
  which new individuals are budded off. The stalks bend from time to time in a curious spasmodic
  manner, by which means the calyces are moved about with an irritable and angry air. A good idea of
  the way in which the tentacles are folded away when the animal is disturbed may be obtained by
  putting the two wrists together, with the fingers spread out to represent the tentacles, the
  retraction of which would be represented by turning the tips of the fingers down into the space,
  the "vestibule," between the two palms. A delicate fold of skin growing from the edge of the calyx
  closes over the retracted tentacles, owing to the contraction of a sphincter muscle present in its
  circular edge. The body-wall is not separated from the alimentary canal by a definite body-cavity,
  so that there is no obvious distinction between the polypide and the zooecium. The existence of
  the Entoprocta is in fact a strong reason for refusing to admit that these two terms correspond
  with two different kinds of individuals.</p>

  <p>Let us now imagine the condition we should have if a large and continuous cavity were developed
  between the alimentary canal and the body-wall. The body-wall would clearly have the general
  relations of a zooecium, while the alimentary canal and tentacles would obviously correspond with
  the polypide. The existence of the body-cavity would make it possible for the animal to
  <i>retract</i> its tentacles instead of merely turning them in. Regarded in this way, there is but
  little difficulty in comparing the Ectoprocta with the Entoprocta.</p>

  <p>The calyces are deciduous, <i>i.e.</i> they are lost from time to time, the end of the stalk
  then producing a polypide-bud, which <span class="pagenum" id="page489"><span
  class="smaller">{489}</span></span>forms the vestibule and alimentary canal of a new calyx. Hence
  the phenomenon which may so commonly be noticed in <i>Pedicellina</i> of a "young head on old
  shoulders." The loss of the calyces may have some relation to the formation of the "brown bodies"
  in the Ectoprocta.</p>

  <p>Another Entoproct, <i>Loxosoma</i> (Fig. 245) is remarkable for being the only Polyzoon which
  is not colonial. The buds, which are formed in two lateral series, break off as soon as they are
  mature, and at once begin to lead an independent existence. <i>Loxosoma</i> is further remarkable
  for being almost invariably found commensally with other animals, where it may occur in enormous
  numbers. <i>L. phascolosomatum</i>, common in the Channel Islands, is only found on the tip of the
  tail of <i>Phascolosoma</i> (see p. <a href="#page428">428</a>), which inhabits the mud of
  <i>Zostera</i>-beds. Other species are found on the external surface of certain sponges
  (<i>Tethya</i>, <i>Euspongia</i>, <i>Cacospongia</i>); or on the outside of a compound Ascidian,
  <i>Leptoclinum</i>, which may itself be carried about as a detachable covering on the back of a
  crab (<i>Dromia</i>). Another species is found on the ventral surface of the Polychaet
  <i>Aphrodite</i>, and of its ally <i>Hermione</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>L. annelidicola</i>, an interesting species recently investigated by Prouho,<a id="NtA_540"
  href="#Nt_540"><sup>[540]</sup></a> was originally described in 1863 as a Trematode, under the
  name of <i>Cyclatella</i>. It escaped further notice until it was again found in the neighbourhood
  of Roscoff, in Brittany, on certain Polychaets belonging to the family Maldanidae (see p. <a
  href="#page332">332</a>). The calyx has a very flattened form, and is borne on a short stalk,
  which terminates in a large attaching disc, formerly mistaken for the sucker of a Trematode. The
  features in which this species differs from other members of the genus are shown by M. Prouho to
  be correlated with its mode of life. The animal has the habit of lying flat on its back, the disc
  at the end of its stalk being firmly attached to the skin of the worm, and its short stalk being
  bent round into a curve so <span class="pagenum" id="page490"><span
  class="smaller">{490}</span></span>as to bring the calyx into a supine position, with its
  lophophore directed upwards. This habit, together with its flattened form, prevents it from being
  crushed between the worm and its tube. But without some further provision its position might be
  merely a source of danger. For supposing the calyx to be directed backwards in relation to the
  worm, a sudden backward movement of the latter into its tube might bring the <i>Loxosoma</i> into
  fatal contact with the inner surface of the tube. There would obviously not be sufficient room to
  turn round in a <i>vertical</i> plane, so as to bring the body into a position of safety,
  <i>i.e.</i> into a position in which it moves stalk first. But by a beautiful arrangement of the
  muscles of its stalk this movement is effected in a horizontal plane; on touching the
  <i>Loxosoma</i> with the point of a needle it would swing round in this way through 180&deg; with "une
  rapidit&eacute; qui &eacute;tonne."</p>

  <p><i>Urnatella</i><a id="NtA_541" href="#Nt_541"><sup>[541]</sup></a> is a beautiful form with a
  segmented stalk, the stalks usually arising in pairs from a common base. It has at present only
  been found in fresh water in the United States.</p>

  <p>In <i>Pedicellina</i> the plane of the lophophore is at right angles to the stalk, which is

  base of the calyx. In <i>Urnatella</i> we find an intermediate condition, the lophophore
  resembling that of <i>Loxosoma</i>, while the constriction at the base of the calyx is similar to
  that of <i>Pedicellina</i>. Since the latter is known to pass in its development<a id="NtA_543"

  that <i>Loxosoma</i> is a more archaic form than <i>Pedicellina</i>. In other respects, the

  it is not known whether they are connected with the excretory tubes of the calyx. The animals are
  either hermaphrodite or have separate sexes, and the generative organs open by ducts of their own
  into the vestibule. The nervous system consists of a ganglion placed between the mouth and the
  anus, giving off a set of nerves, many of which end in delicate tactile hairs placed on the

  <p><b>Fresh-water Polyzoa.</b>&mdash;Although the Gymnolaemata are ordinarily marine animals,
  fresh-water examples from this Order are not altogether wanting. The Ctenostomata among the
  typically marine groups show the most tendency to stray into fresh-water.</p>

  <p><i>Alcyonidium</i> and <i>Bowerbankia</i> (Fig. 238) flourish in estuaries, while
  <i>Victorella</i> and <i>Paludicella</i> (Fig. 250) are only known as fresh or brackish water
  forms. <i>Victorella</i> was named after the Victoria Docks in London, where it was first found;
  more recently it has also been discovered in other parts of England and on the Continent.<a

  href="#Nt_546"><sup>[546]</sup></a> which have been described from fresh water of India and China
  respectively, is at present uncertain. The undoubted Cheilostome <i>Membranipora</i> has, however,
  a British representative (<i>M. monostachys</i>), which occurs in brackish water, in ditches on
  the coast of East Anglia. It is there known to form "friable, irregularly-shaped, sponge-like
  masses," which grow on water-plants.<a id="NtA_547" href="#Nt_547"><sup>[547]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page493"><span class="smaller">{493}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Entoprocta, as we have seen, are represented in fresh water by the genus
  <i>Urnatella</i>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Phylactolaemata</b> are an exclusively fresh-water group, and they are believed by
  Kraepelin<a id="NtA_548" href="#Nt_548"><sup>[548]</sup></a> to have been derived from the
  Ctenostomata. Many of their special peculiarities can, with great probability, be regarded as
  adaptations to a fresh-water existence. This is particularly clear in the all but universal habit
  of dying down in the winter, and in the occurrence of the so-called statoblasts (Fig. 251), which
  are hard-shelled reproductive bodies, absolutely restricted to the Phylactolaemata, and capable of
  resisting the winter's cold and even a certain amount of drying up. Phylactolaemata have indeed
  been recorded from the tropics; but it is not yet sufficiently clear how they there behave in
  these respects. F. M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_549" href="#Nt_549"><sup>[549]</sup></a> has found these
  animals in Brazil, where they are said to be more common at certain periods of the year than at
  others. Stuhlmann has found them in Tropical Africa (Victoria Nyanza, etc.);<a id="NtA_550"
  href="#Nt_550"><sup>[550]</sup></a> and Meissner<a id="NtA_551"
  href="#Nt_551"><sup>[551]</sup></a> has discovered the sessile statoblasts of <i>Plumatella</i> on
  the shells preserved in the Berlin Museum, of species of the Mollusc <i>Aetheria</i> from various
  localities in Africa. Fresh-water representatives of a considerable number of other groups of
  animals agree with the Phylactolaemata in the possession of reproductive bodies which are
  protected by hard coats. Such, for instance, are the ephippian ova of <i>Daphnia</i>&mdash;bodies
  which have an extraordinary external similarity to statoblasts&mdash;the gemmules of Spongillidae,
  the winter-eggs of Rhabdocoels and Rotifers, and the cysts of Protozoa. The evolution of these
  bodies in so many widely different cases may have been due to the selection of variations
  calculated to minimise the dangers attendant on the drying up of the water in summer, or on its
  freezing in winter.</p>

  <p>The Phylactolaemata are by no means uncommon, although they can seldom be found without a
  careful search. Their presence may often be detected by taking advantage of the property of the
  free statoblasts of rising to the top of the water, where they can be discovered by skimming the
  surface with a fine hand-net.</p>

  <p>The colonies themselves are usually found attached to water-plants, roots of trees or stones.
  Most of them flourish best in <span class="pagenum" id="page494"><span
  class="smaller">{494}</span></span>a zone not more than two feet below the surface. Certain
  species show a preference for floating leaves, such as those of water-lilies, where they are not
  liable to be dried up by alterations in the level of the water. Some forms (e.g.
  <i>Plumatella</i>, Fig. 246) are, however, able to withstand being dried for some time. Most
  species prefer shady places, and accordingly settle on the lower sides of leaves and sticks.
  Others (e.g. <i>Cristatella</i>, Fig. 247) have no objection to the direct rays of the sun. Most
  forms prefer still water, but one or two are found in running water.</p>

  <p><i>Fredericella</i> is a common constituent of the deep-water fauna of Swiss Lakes (down to
  over forty fathoms); and reaches there a size considerably larger than the shallow-water form of
  the same species. <i>Paludicella</i> is common at thirteen fathoms. These two genera, with
  <i>Plumatella</i>, have been found in absolute darkness, under a pressure of 2&frac12;-5&frac12; atmospheres, in
  the Hamburg aqueduct. The Polyzoa and other organisms growing in the water-supply of Hamburg were
  accused of being concerned in the spreading of cholera, during the recent epidemic, by choking up
  the water-pipes, and creating obstructions which formed a favourable nidus for the development of
  cholera-germs.</p>

  <p>The colony may take the form of a series of delicate, branching tubes (<i>Plumatella</i>,
  <i>Fredericella</i>), of more massive aggregations of parallel tubes (as in the Alcyonelloid forms
  of <i>Plumatella</i>), or of gelatinous masses of varying size (<i>Lophopus</i>,
  <i>Cristatella</i>).</p>

  <p><i>Cristatella mucedo</i> (Fig. 247) is remarkable for its power of moving from place to place;
  it consists of an elongated mass of greenish, gelatinous substance, which, in its fully developed
  state, may reach a length of eight inches or more, with a transverse diameter of three-eighths of
  an inch. It has a flattened sole on which it crawls, while the graceful plumes of its numerous
  polypides protrude as a delicate fringe from its upper side.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page495"><span class="smaller">{495}</span></span></div>

  <p>The tentacles are about eighty to ninety in number, and they are, as in other Phylactolaemata,
  united at their bases by a delicate web. The lophophore is horse-shoe-shaped (Fig. 236, 3)
  throughout the group, with the exception of <i>Fredericella</i>, in which genus it is
  circular.</p>

  <p>In some Phylactolaemata the polypide has been observed to interlace its tentacles, so that the
  plume becomes a kind of cage, in which the more active Infusoria are imprisoned until their
  struggles have so far weakened them that they are swept into the mouth by the action of the cilia
  of the tentacles.<a id="NtA_552" href="#Nt_552"><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Around the edge of the <i>Cristatella</i> is found a zone of budding tissue, which gives rise
  continuously to new individuals. Now, whereas in Gymnolaemata the growing edge gives rise to
  zooecia, whose cavities become completely cut off from that of the older ones; in Phylactolaemata
  the partitions between the zooecia are never completed. The body-cavity of <i>Cristatella</i> is
  thus a continuous space, interrupted at the margin only by vertical septa (see Fig. 247), which
  represent the partitions between the zooecia of other forms.</p>

  <p>The body-wall consists of two epithelial layers of ectoderm and mesoderm, between which is a
  layer of muscular fibres. <span class="pagenum" id="page496"><span
  class="smaller">{496}</span></span>Parts of the epithelium lining the body-cavity are ciliated.
  Into the common body-cavity hang the polypide-buds at the edge of the colony, and the mature
  polypides in the more central regions. There are usually three rows of polypides on either side of
  the middle line, in the neighbourhood of which is an area devoid of polypides, but containing
  "brown bodies" and statoblasts. The polypides nearest to the middle line pass in succession into
  the condition of "brown bodies," while young buds near the margin grow up coincidently to form new
  polypides.</p>

  <p>The movement of the colony is in the direction of the long axis, although either end may go
  first. Sir John Dalyell records an observation<a id="NtA_553" href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a>
  on a specimen (about one inch long) which was artificially divided into two halves. The two halves
  "receded from each other as if by common consent," and were nearly an inch apart in twenty
  hours.</p>

  <p>An observation made at Cambridge on a small colony of about 7 mm. in greatest length gave the
  following results. The colony moved 13 mm. (nearly twice its own length) in 8&frac14; hours: in the next
  40 hours it moved 20 mm. (&#x2158; inch); while in the following 24 hours it moved only 6 mm.
  Large colonies change their place only with reluctance.</p>

  <p>The locomotive power possessed by <i>Cristatella</i> is not unique among Phylactolaemata.
  <i>Lophopus</i>, the first fresh-water Polyzoon of which any description was published, was
  originally described by Trembley in 1744 under the name of the "Polype &agrave; pannache." Trembley
  observed the spontaneous division of the colony, <i>followed by the gradual separation from one
  another of the daughter-colonies</i>.<a id="NtA_554" href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a> The power
  of dividing spontaneously is also possessed by colonies of <i>Cristatella</i> and of
  <i>Pectinatella</i>.</p>

  <p>The colonies of <i>Lophopus</i> are surrounded by an excessively hyaline ectocyst, and are
  usually triangular, as shown by Fig. 248. When division is about to occur, the base of the
  triangle becomes indented, and the indentation travels towards the apex in such a way as to bisect
  the triangle. The two halves diverge from one another during the process, so that before division
  is complete, they are looking, in some cases, in opposite directions. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page497"><span class="smaller">{497}</span></span>After a time the narrow connection breaks,
  and two new colonies are formed.</p>

  <p>Fig. 248 shows a colony shortly after division has taken place. The colony had moved forwards,
  in a direction away from its apex, for three days in a nearly straight line, the distances moved
  in each day being respectively 6, 8&frac12;, 8&frac12; mm. These observations, for which I am indebted to Mr.
  Lister, show a considerably higher speed than in those recorded by Trembley, who observed no
  colony which moved more than half an inch (12.5 mm.) in eight days.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pectinatella</i> also has some power of locomotion. This magnificent Polyzoon
  occurs in masses several feet in length (as much as six feet in <i>P. gelatinosa</i> from Japan<a
  id="NtA_555" href="#Nt_555"><sup>[555]</sup></a>), and four to eight inches in thickness. The
  greater part of <i>P. magnifica</i><a id="NtA_556" href="#Nt_556"><sup>[556]</sup></a> consists of
  a thick, opaline, and gelatinous ectocyst, the upper surface of which is covered by hundreds of
  rosette-like colonies, which increase in number by division. The masses are thus aggregations of
  colonies, which secrete a common basal ectocyst. The latter decays in the autumn; and the separate
  rosettes, or groups of them, may thus be set free, being found as floating masses, which may again
  attach themselves to a solid object till the time of their death. <i>Pectinatella</i> has not yet
  been recorded in England, although, considering the ease with which statoblasts are transported,
  it is by no means improbable that it will eventually be recorded as a British genus. It is at
  present known to inhabit America, Japan, and Hamburg.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is by no means certain what is the mechanism by which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page498"><span class="smaller">{498}</span></span>movement takes place in the above cases. The
  ectocyst of <i>Cristatella</i> is confined to the base of the colony, and there forms a thin slimy
  film, which lubricates the surface over which the animal moves. It has been stated<a id="NtA_557"
  href="#Nt_557"><sup>[557]</sup></a> that progression is produced in the following way. The
  polypides are withdrawn by means of retractor muscles, which originate from the septa and inner
  surface of the sole. Thus at each retraction of any polypide, the muscle pulls on a portion of the
  sole. Should the expanded polypides place themselves in a suitable position, the movement will be
  in the direction of the resultant of the forces due to the separate retractor muscles; while it is
  probable that their cilia assist in the onward movement. It should be noted that it is definitely
  stated that a colony in which all the polypides are retracted can alter its position,<a
  id="NtA_558" href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a> although even then the retractor muscles might
  still contract to some extent.</p>

  <p>The movement probably depends on several causes. It must probably be conceded that the sole
  itself has some effect on this process. Its outer cells are contractile, and have the power of
  raising themselves from the underlying ectocyst. They may then again attach themselves, and this
  new attachment does not always take place in exactly the same place as the former one. Any
  movement of the muscles of the sole, or of the retractor muscles, will thus shift the skin to a
  new place.<a id="NtA_559" href="#Nt_559"><sup>[559]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Protrusion of the Polypide.</b>&mdash;While it is perfectly clear that retraction is
  principally performed by the great retractor muscles acting directly on the polypide, it is less
  easy to explain the converse movement. There can, however, be little doubt that protrusion is
  effected by the pressure of the fluid of the body-cavity, caused in large part by contractions of
  the common body-wall.</p>

  <p>Now since, in <i>Cristatella</i>, the body-cavity is a continuous space, any pressure on the
  fluid must act uniformly on all its contents. The cause which determines the protrusion of a
  polypide is thus to a large extent the relaxation of the sphincter-muscle which surrounds its
  orifice, aided by special muscles which dilate the orifice. Any polypide which is retracted while
  the pressure of the fluid in the body-cavity is sufficient to keep other polypides protruded, must
  therefore keep either its <span class="pagenum" id="page499"><span
  class="smaller">{499}</span></span>retractor-muscles or its sphincter in a state of contraction in
  order to remain in that position. And as a matter of fact, <i>Cristatella</i> and <i>Lophopus</i>
  differ from most other Polyzoa in the readiness with which they expand their tentacles, after they
  have been induced to retract themselves by mechanical irritation.</p>

  <p><i>Plumatella</i> and other forms have a chitinous ectocyst, which, however, is sticky when it
  is first formed. By virtue of this property, the branches become attached to the leaf on which the
  colony is growing, and may have their natural transparency obscured by taking up foreign bodies.
  The stiffness of the ectocyst naturally involves some modification of the process by which the
  polypides are protruded. In some cases, this is effected by the separation of the endocyst from
  the ectocyst in the lower parts of the tube. The muscles of the body-wall can thus press on the
  fluid of the body-cavity without being restrained by the inflexible ectocyst. In other cases, the
  tube of ectocyst is rendered flexible by the presence of a thin line along one side where the
  chitin is deficient.</p>

  <p>The upper end of the retracted tentacle-sheath is connected with the body-wall by bands known
  as the parieto-vaginal muscles (Fig. 249, <i>p</i>). These <span class="pagenum"
  id="page500"><span class="smaller">{500}</span></span>serve not only to dilate the orifice when
  protrusion is commencing, but also to prevent the polypide from being forced out too far. They are
  arranged in such a way that a circular fold, the duplicature (<i>d</i>), is never turned inside
  out, even in the state of complete protrusion of the polypide.</p>

  <p>The mechanism of the protrusion of the polypide in the Gymnolaemata is in many cases obscure.
  The body-wall is not muscular in this group, in some forms of which, however, short strands known
  as the parietal muscles (Fig. 234, <i>p</i>) pass across the body-cavity from one point to another
  of the zooecium. As doubts have been thrown on the function of these muscles in causing
  protrusion, it will be worth while to refer to the detailed and convincing statements of Farre,<a
  id="NtA_560" href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a> relating to this point.</p>

  <p>Farre's observations were made on certain transparent Ctenostomes (<i>Bowerbankia</i> and
  <i>Farrella</i>). He states that the parietal muscles "were distinctly seen to contract whenever
  the protrusion of the animal took place, and to become relaxed again upon its retiring into its
  cell." Their contraction may indent the outline of the ectocyst, or may cause the separation of
  the endocyst from the ectocyst. The endocyst is then drawn into longitudinal lines at the origin
  and insertion of these fibres. It is further suggested that some part is played in the process by
  the muscular walls of the alimentary canal, which is a good deal bent in the retracted condition.
  The effort to straighten itself is believed to have some share in forcing out the polypide. The
  flexible, membranous character of the "aperture" (see p. <a href="#page524">524</a>) in
  <i>Membranipora</i> (Fig. 256, A) is said by Nitsche<a id="NtA_561"
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a> to be an arrangement for the protrusion of the polypides; the
  parietal muscles passing from the lateral walls of the zooecium to the upper membranous wall,
  which is accordingly depressed by their contraction.</p>

  <p>Although it is hardly possible to doubt the accuracy of Farre's observations, which have,
  moreover, been confirmed by Hincks, it is by no means certain that this is the whole explanation
  in all cases. Oka,<a id="NtA_562" href="#Nt_562"><sup>[562]</sup></a> for instance, states that
  protrusion of the polypide in Phylactolaemata can be effected in a branch whose body-wall has been
  cut open. Pergens<a id="NtA_563" href="#Nt_563"><sup>[563]</sup></a> believes that the diaphragm
  (Fig. <span class="pagenum" id="page501"><span class="smaller">{501}</span></span>234, <i>d</i>)
  acts as a pump, introducing water from the tentacle-sheath into the body-cavity, into which it is
  said by him to open, and so forcing out the polypide. It is probable that many of the forms which
  have a stiff, unyielding ectocyst possess special arrangements for introducing water in some way
  into the space bounded by the ectocyst,<a id="NtA_564" href="#Nt_564"><sup>[564]</sup></a> and so
  forcing out the polypide. Such, for instance, may be the median pore which occurs beneath the
  orifice in <i>Microporella</i> (Fig. 241, A, <i>mp</i>), and in certain other cases.</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction of Phylactolaemata.</b>&mdash;Sexual reproduction takes place in
  <i>Cristatella</i> from June to August. The spermatozoa are ordinarily produced on the funiculus.
  The ovaries usually occur on the inner side of the common wall of the colony, not far below the
  orifice of a polypide. Each ovary matures a single egg, which develops <i>in situ</i>, the free
  larva leaving the colony by the orifice of one of the degenerated polypides.</p>

  <p>A second method of reproduction takes place by means of the statoblasts, which are developed on
  the funiculus (Fig. 249). According to Verworn,<a id="NtA_565" href="#Nt_565"><sup>[565]</sup></a>
  each statoblast arises from a single cell of the funiculus; and on this view, the statoblast is,
  as supposed by the earlier observers, a special kind of winter-egg. According to more recent
  researches,<a id="NtA_566" href="#Nt_566"><sup>[566]</sup></a> the funiculus consists of a central
  axis, formed from the ectoderm, and of an outer sheath of mesoderm-cells; the statoblast is
  developed from the two kinds of cells of which the funiculus is composed, and is consequently
  comparable in its mode of origin to an ordinary bud. Its special peculiarities are: its origin as
  an internal bud, its possession of a chitinous shell, and the fact that it is destined to leave
  the parent colony, and to develop, after a period of rest, into a new colony. Germination takes
  place by the formation of a polypide-bud inside the statoblast, which finally splits along its
  equator into two halves. The contents emerge as a young colony which possesses at least one
  fully-formed polypide.</p>

  <p>Remarkable structures known as "hibernacula" occur in the fresh-water Ctenostomes,
  <i>Paludicella</i> and <i>Victorella</i>. These bodies are in the former (Fig. 250, B) specially
  modified <i>external</i> buds, which persist through the winter when the rest of the colony dies
  down. At the close of winter the shell splits into two <span class="pagenum" id="page502"><span
  class="smaller">{502}</span></span>halves, exactly as takes place in the statoblasts, and a young
  colony emerges.  It is possible that the statoblasts may have been evolved from a hibernaculum,
  which was at first produced externally, but has become modified in such a way as to acquire an
  internal mode of origin.<a id="NtA_567" href="#Nt_567"><sup>[567]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The simplest known statoblast is that of <i>Fredericella</i> (Fig. 251, A), which differs from
  that of other Phylactolaemata in having no ring of air-cells. In <i>Plumatella</i>, the statoblast
  (Fig. 251, B) has a broad equatorial ring of air-cells, which enable it to float at the surface of
  the water on the decay of the parent tubes. In some species, certain statoblasts which are
  produced in the adherent parts of the colony remain attached to the substratum. These "sessile
  statoblasts" may have no trace of the ring of air-cells; but the fact that many sessile
  statoblasts have rudiments of this structure suggests that they are a secondary modification of
  the floating statoblast. In <i>Lophopus</i> (Fig. 251, C) the ring of air-cells is very broad, and
  is pointed at each end; while in <i>Cristatella</i> (Fig. 251, D) and in <i>Pectinatella</i> the
  statoblast is circular, and possesses an armature of hooked spines. That of <i>Cristatella</i>,
  measures about .75 mm. in its greatest length.</p>

      (From Kraepelin.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Kraepelin has suggested that the above order of increasing complexity of the statoblasts
  corresponds with the order in which the genera to which they respectively belong would be placed,
  on the assumption that the Phylactolaemata have been derived from the Ctenostomata. Thus, in
  <i>Fredericella</i>, the form of the lophophore is circular, as in the Gymnolaemata. The number of
  the tentacles is comparatively small (20-24). The arborescent form of the colony resembles that of
  many Ctenostomes, and the zooecia are more or less cut off from one another by incomplete
  septa.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page503"><span class="smaller">{503}</span></span></div>

  <p>In <i>Plumatella</i>, the lophophore has become horse-shoe-shaped, and the tentacles are more
  numerous (38-60). In general form and in the arrangement of the septa this genus resembles
  <i>Fredericella</i>, with which it may easily be confused.</p>

  <p>In <i>Cristatella</i> we have the most highly modified of all the Phylactolaemata. The
  individuality of the zooecium is here subordinated to that of the colony as a whole. The branched
  arrangement of the zooecia is greatly obscured. The body-cavities have become completely
  confluent, although rudiments of the septa still exist. The ectocyst has been lost, with the
  exception of the basal layer of the colony. The tentacles are more numerous (80-90); and in
  accordance with the increase in the elaboration of the genus, its statoblasts belong to the most
  complicated type known.</p>

  <p>The production of <i>floating</i> statoblasts may seem a strange adaptation to the conditions
  of fresh-water life, since it might be assumed, <i>a priori</i>, that these structures would be
  specially liable to be frozen during the winter. The following experiments made by Braem<a
  id="NtA_568" href="#Nt_568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> show, however, that the germinating power of the
  statoblasts is improved by a certain amount of frost. A number of statoblasts were taken; half of
  these were placed in water, which was then frozen; and these were found to germinate readily when
  afterwards exposed to suitable conditions. The other half were not subjected to the action of
  frost; and these could not be made to germinate, even although the water had been cooled to a
  point slightly above the freezing point. It thus appears that the buoyancy, so far from being a
  risk, is a means of exposing the statoblast to the conditions which are most favourable to its
  later development.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page504"><span class="smaller">{504}</span></span></div>

  <p>Braem supposes that the beneficial action of frost is due to a lowering of the vital energy of
  the statoblast. As in the case of reproductive bodies known in many other fresh-water organisms,
  the statoblast germinates only after a period of rest. Although this period is often shortened by
  a lowering of the temperature, it can also be induced by the exclusion of air, as in an experiment
  during which the statoblasts were enclosed in airtight tubes. The respiratory processes were
  thereby lessened, and the germinating power was materially improved.</p>

  <p>Since the development of the statoblasts depends largely on the temperature, the first warm
  weather in early spring will probably induce the germination of those which are floating; and the
  young colony, leaving the protection of the statoblast, will become susceptible to frost. But even
  if the first-formed colonies are killed off by a subsequent frost, other statoblasts which have
  remained in the mud during the winter are disentangled from time to time, and germinate on
  reaching the surface.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The protective value of the shell is also shown by the fact that the
  statoblast may be kept for some months in a dry condition without losing its power of germination.
  There can be little doubt that the capability of withstanding desiccation enables the species to
  enlarge its area of distribution. It is asserted that fresh-water Polyzoa decrease in abundance in
  proportion to the distance from the mouth of the river in which they are found. The current will
  naturally tend to bring together the statoblasts from the Polyzoa growing in the upper waters.</p>

  <p>Nothing is more surprising than the wide geographical distribution of the Phylactolaemata. The
  European genera are all recorded from North America. <i>Fredericella</i>, <i>Plumatella</i>, and
  <i>Lophopus</i> are further recorded from Australia; while <i>Plumatella</i> is known to occur
  also in Malacca, the Philippine Islands, India, Japan, Africa, and South America, It is even
  stated that some of the Australian <i>species</i> are identical with those found in Europe.</p>

  <p>Some of the fresh-water Polyzoa are extremely variable, and observers are by no means agreed in
  deciding whether certain well-known forms are to be regarded as varieties or as species. While
  certain genera, such as <i>Cristatella</i> and <i>Lophopus</i>, are comparatively constant in
  their form, <i>Plumatella</i> is excessively variable. <i>Plumatella</i> has a number of species
  greater than that of any other form, and the genus has a wider distribution than any <span
  class="pagenum" id="page505"><span class="smaller">{505}</span></span>other. This greater
  variation of species of the dominant genus is in complete accordance with the general law
  enunciated by Darwin that "wide-ranging, much diffused, and common species vary most."</p>

  <p>While the ordinary forms of <i>Plumatella</i> consist of branching colonies, which are either
  completely adherent to their substratum, or grow in a more or less erect manner, another habit
  which is assumed by this genus is so different from the first that it has been considered to mark
  a distinct genus, <i>Alcyonella</i>. The Alcyonelloid form (Fig. 246, A) consists of closely
  packed tubes which stand more or less at right angles to their substratum, which they may cover
  with a dense mass an inch thick, and with a superficial area of several square inches. But in
  spite of this difference, it is possible that <i>A. fungosa</i> is only a variety of an ordinary
  <i>Plumatella</i> form. Whether this is so or not, a typical <i>Plumatella</i> may in places take
  on an Alcyonelloid habit; and parts of an <i>Alcyonella</i> may become so lax in growth as to
  resemble a <i>Plumatella</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Reproductive Processes of Polyzoa in general.</b></p>

  <p>In studying the reproductive processes of Polyzoa, we have to deal with two very distinct
  phenomena; firstly, with the development of eggs; and secondly, with the formation of buds.</p>

  <p>The process of budding usually does no more than increase the number of individuals in a colony
  which already exists, and is seldom responsible for the commencement of a new colony. In
  <i>Loxosoma</i>, however, the buds break off and lead an independent existence; and in the
  Phylactolaemata a large proportion of the colonies have their origin in the statoblasts. In
  certain cases, again, new colonies may be formed by the detachment of parts of an old one, as by
  the fission of <i>Cristatella</i> and <i>Lophopus</i>, or by the breaking up of a richly-branched
  species into several colonies by the decay of the proximal parts.</p>

  <p>We may then in the majority of cases look to an embryo for the foundation of a new colony. The
  embryo develops into a larva, which, after a period in which it swims freely, settles down, and is
  metamorphosed into the first zooecium. This primary individual forms the starting-point of a
  colony, and often differs to a considerable extent from the other zooecia which arise from it. In
  Cyclostomata, for instance, the proximal end of the primary zooecium permanently retains the
  disc-like shape assumed by the young larva when it first fixed itself. The primary zooecium may be
  recognised with equal ease in many Cheilostomata, and may differ from its successors by possessing
  a richer development of marginal spines, or in other respects.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;Eggs and spermatozoa are commonly found in the same colony,
  either in different individuals, or else in the same zooecium (see Fig. 234, p. <a
  href="#page469">469</a>). In some cases, the zooecium first develops spermatozoa, and later eggs.
  The Entoprocta have a more marked separation of the sexes than obtains in other Polyzoa. The genus
  <i>Loxosoma</i> is perhaps always dioecious (<i>i.e.</i> with separate sexes). <i>Pedicellina</i>
  is sometimes found with ovaries and testes in the same individual, sometimes with these organs in
  different individuals; and it is not clear whether a given species always behaves alike in these
  respects.</p>

  <p>The reproductive organs of the Entoprocta open by ducts of their own into the vestibule. In the
  Ectoprocta they are developed in the body-cavity, and they have no ducts.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page507"><span class="smaller">{507}</span></span></div>

  <p>The fate of the ripe egg differs widely in different cases. In the Entoprocta it develops in a
  kind of brood-pouch formed from part of the vestibule. The fact that in <i>Pedicellina</i> (Fig.
  243) the embryos grow largely during their development, shows that nutritive material must be
  supplied to them from the parent. There is reason to believe that the epithelium of the
  brood-pouch is responsible for this process. The eggs are also known to develop at the expense of
  nutritive substances prepared by the parent in the ovicells of the Cyclostomata. In other cases,
  as in some species of <i>Alcyonidium</i>, the egg is large, and its copious yolk doubtless
  supplies a large part of the material required for development.</p>

  <p>In the Ectoprocta, development takes place in a variety of places. In most Cheilostomata a
  single egg passes into the globular ovicell, which is formed above the orifice of many of the
  zooecia. In certain Ctenostomata,<a id="NtA_569" href="#Nt_569"><sup>[569]</sup></a>
  Phylactolaemata,<a id="NtA_570" href="#Nt_570"><sup>[570]</sup></a> and Cyclostomata,<a
  id="NtA_571" href="#Nt_571"><sup>[571]</sup></a> the ripe egg is taken up by a rudimentary
  polypide-bud, which is specially formed for the purpose. In the Ctenostomata and in the
  fresh-water Polyzoa these buds, if present, are found in ordinary zooecia which do not become
  modified externally in any special way. In the Cyclostomata (<i>Crisia</i>), on the contrary, the
  formation of the polypide-bud is intimately bound up with the development of the ovicell. The
  number of the zooecia which produce eggs that are capable of development is greatly restricted in
  this group. The ovicell, which contains numerous embryos, is not merely a portion of a zooecium,
  as in the Cheilostomata; but it is probably to be regarded as a modification of the entire fertile
  zooecium or zooecia. These take on an appearance widely differing from that of the ordinary
  zooecia, and in course of time give rise to the ovicells (see Fig. 237).</p>

  <p>In all these cases the egg develops inside the parent, and it was hardly known, before the
  publication of the interesting researches of M. Prouho,<a id="NtA_572"
  href="#Nt_572"><sup>[572]</sup></a> that some of the Polyzoa lay eggs which develop externally. In
  these cases a considerable number of eggs are produced simultaneously by a single zooecium. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page508"><span class="smaller">{508}</span></span>M. Prouho further throws
  light on a much contested subject; namely, the nature of the so-called "intertentacular organ"
  (<i>i</i>, Fig. 234, p. <a href="#page469">469</a>), described so long ago as 1837 by Farre,<a
  id="NtA_573" href="#Nt_573"><sup>[573]</sup></a> but looked for in vain by the majority of later
  observers.</p>

  <p>The failure to find this organ, even in species which possess it, <i>in certain
  individuals</i>, according to Farre's statements, is now satisfactorily explained by M. Prouho,
  who shows that while it is absent in a large number of polypides, it is normally present in those
  individuals which possess an ovary, and in those only; and that its primary function is that of an
  oviduct.</p>

  <p>The intertentacular organ is an unpaired ciliated tube, which is situated between the two
  tentacles which are nearest to the ganglion. In the retracted condition of the polypide, it opens
  from the body-cavity into the tentacle-sheath; and in the expanded condition, directly to the
  exterior.</p>

  <p>In the remarkable case of <i>Alcyonidium duplex</i>, each zooecium normally possesses two
  sexual polypides. The first of these produces a testis and then becomes a "brown body." The second
  is meanwhile developed, and produces an ovary and an intertentacular organ, a structure which was
  not present in the male polypide. The eggs pass through the intertentacular organ into the
  tentacle-sheath, and attach themselves to the diaphragm (<i>d</i>, Fig. 234), where they remain
  during their development.</p>

  <p>Although the intertentacular organ has been found by Prouho in female polypides only, it would
  perhaps be going too far to assert that it is confined to polypides of that sex. Hincks<a
  id="NtA_574" href="#Nt_574"><sup>[574]</sup></a> has observed the passage of spermatozoa in
  enormous numbers through the organ, although it may be noted that there is no sufficient proof
  that eggs were not present as well in these zooecia. It further appears that in some cases waste
  matters may be removed from the body-cavity through the same passage.</p>

  <p>It may be presumed that the egg is normally fertilised by a spermatozoon, although this is at
  present largely a matter of inference. It is believed by Joliet<a id="NtA_575"
  href="#Nt_575"><sup>[575]</sup></a> that fertilisation is reciprocal, although Prouho has come to
  the opposite conclusion. Joliet has, however, very justly pointed out that the enormous number of
  spermatozoa developed by a single individual would be disproportionately large, if their function
  were merely to fertilise the <span class="pagenum" id="page509"><span
  class="smaller">{509}</span></span>ovum in the same zooecium. According to his view, the egg is
  fertilised by a spermatozoon after it has passed into the tentacle-sheath or ovicell, or some
  other place where it is in free communication with the outside water.</p>

  <p><b>Development and Affinities.</b>&mdash;Few parts of the history of the Polyzoa are more
  fascinating than that which deals with their development; and it is probable that no other is
  capable of giving so much insight into the affinities of the several groups to one another and to
  other groups of the animal kingdom.</p>

  <p>The comparative study of the larvae of the Polyzoa may be said to date from 1877, when J.
  Barrois published an elaborate Monograph<a id="NtA_576" href="#Nt_576"><sup>[576]</sup></a> on
  this subject. Although some of Barrois' earlier opinions have been subsequently modified, this
  work still gives the best figures of the external form of the beautiful larvae of many genera. A
  detailed account of the larval forms of Polyzoa must be omitted from want of space; and the
  general conclusions only can be given.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span></div>

  <p>The larvae of the Entoprocta (Fig. 252, A) resemble the so-called "Trochosphere" of Polychaeta
  (see p. <a href="#page274">274</a>). The common characters shared by the larvae of Chaetopoda,
  Echiuroid Gephyrea, Mollusca, and Polyzoa, and by adult Rotifera, may well point to the derivation
  of these groups from a common ancestor. On this assumption, it is possible that the Polyzoa have
  been derived from forms which existed long ages ago, which combined the common characters of these
  groups, and the structure of which we can picture to ourselves only so far as the "Trochosphere"
  larva can be taken to represent it in a much simplified condition. Such a view harmonises well
  with the great antiquity of the Polyzoa. Certain Ectoproct forms have a larva, known as
  <i>Cyphonautes</i> (Fig. 252, B), which closely resembles the larval form of the Entoprocta; and
  it is a fact which probably has considerable significance that this type of larva is known to
  occur only in those species of <i>Membranipora</i> (<i>Electra</i>), <i>Alcyonidium</i>, and
  <i>Hypophorella</i>, which lay eggs.<a id="NtA_577" href="#Nt_577"><sup>[577]</sup></a> This may
  perhaps be regarded as a primitive form of development which has been lost in species in which
  development takes place inside the parent. <i>Cyphonautes compressus</i> (Fig. 252, B), one of the
  commonest objects taken in the surface-net off our own coasts, is the larva of <i>Membranipora</i>
  (<i>Electra</i>) <i>pilosa</i>. Whilst this larva is provided with a well-developed alimentary
  canal, those of most other Ectoprocta possess a mere rudiment of this structure, and depend for
  their nutrition either on yolk present in the egg or on material supplied by the parent. In most
  cases the mature larva has no recognisable trace of a digestive system; and, although it has a
  free-swimming period, it does not become truly pelagic.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal of the larva of <i>Pedicellina</i> is known to persist in the primary
  individual of the colony. In all other known cases, even in that of <i>Cyphonautes</i>, the larva
  at fixation loses practically all its internal organs, and becomes a mere body-wall containing a
  mass of degenerated larval tissues. It is in fact a zooecium containing a "brown body." A
  polypide-bud is now developed, the body-cavity appears as the result of the shrinkage of the
  "brown body," and the primary individual of the colony is thereby established.</p>

  <p>The larvae of the Ectoprocta form a tolerably complete series, starting from
  <i>Cyphonautes</i>, itself allied to the larva of the <span class="pagenum" id="page511"><span
  class="smaller">{511}</span></span>Entoprocta, and ending with the Phylactolaemata.
  <i>Alcyonidium</i> (Fig. 253, B) possesses a rudimentary alimentary canal,<a id="NtA_578"
  href="#Nt_578"><sup>[578]</sup></a> although the most conspicuous structures are those connected
  with the fixation and other phenomena of larval life. The larvae of many of the encrusting
  Cheilostomes (Fig. 253, A) resemble that of <i>Alcyonidium</i>, while those of <i>Bugula</i>,
  <i>Scrupocellaria</i>, etc., belong to a type easily derivable from that of the encrusting forms.
  The branching Ctenostomes (<i>Bowerbankia</i>, etc.) have a larva which may be regarded as
  derived, along slightly different lines, from that of <i>Alcyonidium</i>. The Cyclostomata and the
  Phylactolaemata have the most modified forms of larva. That of the former group may owe some of
  its peculiarities to the occurrence of a remarkable process of embryonic fission, which takes
  place in the ovicell, and as the result of which each egg gives rise to a large number of
  larvae.<a id="NtA_579" href="#Nt_579"><sup>[579]</sup></a> The Phylactolaemata have a larva which
  is not unlike that of <i>Bowerbankia</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>We have seen that the larva at fixation becomes a zooecium, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page512"><span class="smaller">{512}</span></span>which in the Gymnolaemata forms a
  polypide-bud after fixation. The peculiarities of the Phylactolaematous larva may be explained by
  assuming that it becomes a zooecium while it is still free-swimming. Thus the larva of
  <i>Plumatella</i> develops one or sometimes two polypides, which actually reach maturity before
  fixation takes place. That of <i>Cristatella</i> develops from two to twenty<a id="NtA_580"
  href="#Nt_580"><sup>[580]</sup></a> polypides or polypide-buds at the corresponding period, and it
  is in fact a young colony while still free-swimming.</p>

  <p>Now in most colonial animals, such as Coelenterates and Ascidians, the larva metamorphoses
  itself into a temporarily solitary animal, which then gives rise to the remainder of the colony by
  budding. The majority of the Gymnolaemata behave in this way; while the Phylactolaemata may not
  only develop a multiplicity of polypides in their larval stage, but the individuality of the
  zooecia is then just as much obscured as in the adult state. These facts are more easily explained
  if we assume that <i>Cristatella</i> is the end-point in a series than if we suppose it to be a
  starting-point.</p>

  <p>On the view maintained by many authorities, that the Polyzoa are related, through
  <i>Phoronis</i>, with the Gephyrea and the Brachiopoda, we should expect to find in those Polyzoa
  which most closely resemble <i>Phoronis</i> in their adult state&mdash;that is to say in the
  Phylactolaemata&mdash;some indications of affinity to that animal in their development. This is
  emphatically not the case. The hypothesis that the Phylactolaemata are related to <i>Phoronis</i>
  leads, moreover, to the improbable conclusion that the similarities between the Entoproct-larva
  and <i>Cyphonautes</i>, on the one hand, and the Trochosphere larva of Polychaeta, on the other
  hand, is entirely superficial and meaningless. In spite, therefore, of the similarity between
  <i>Phoronis</i> and a single individual of the Phylactolaemata, and in spite of the marked
  resemblance between its nephridia and structures which have been described in <i>Cristatella</i><a
  id="NtA_581" href="#Nt_581"><sup>[581]</sup></a> and <i>Pectinatella</i><a id="NtA_582"
  href="#Nt_582"><sup>[582]</sup></a> the comparative study of the development appears to indicate
  that the resemblances between <i>Phoronis</i> and the Phylactolaemata are the result of a
  coincidence rather than of any close relationship.</p>

  <p>A few points connected with the metamorphosis of the <span class="pagenum" id="page513"><span
  class="smaller">{513}</span></span>Polyzoa deserve more special notice. There is generally great
  difficulty in persuading larvae to fix themselves when kept in a small quantity of water, which
  becomes over-heated in the air of a laboratory. The difficulty may be surmounted by placing
  colonies containing embryos, together with some clean pieces of the seaweed on which the adults
  are habitually found, in a vessel closed by a piece of fine muslin, and by leaving the vessel
  attached to a buoy or in a deep tide-pool. The larvae being without an alimentary canal, fix
  themselves, after a very short free life, on the seaweed.</p>

  <p>It is probable that a great struggle for existence normally takes place at the commencement of
  the metamorphosis. Any one who will examine, in June or July, rocks covered by <i>Fucus</i> on
  which <i>Flustrella hispida</i> is growing, will probably find numerous young fronds of
  <i>Fucus</i>, from half an inch to an inch or two in length, growing under the shelter of the
  older fronds. The bivalve larvae of <i>Flustrella</i> show a marked preference for fixing on these
  young fronds&mdash;perhaps in order that the duration of life of the colony may coincide with that
  of the <i>Fucus</i>&mdash;and these young fronds are commonly covered by very numerous
  recently-fixed larvae, and by young colonies of various ages. Or, it is easy to observe, by
  placing pregnant colonies of <i>Bowerbankia</i> in a vessel of water, that the larvae, which are
  hatched out in thousands, fix themselves in dense masses on certain parts of the wall of the
  vessel. It is clear that but a small proportion of these larvae will find room for further
  development.</p>

  <p>Next with regard to the mode of fixation. Attachment always takes place by the surface on which
  the mouth or its rudiment is situated, and the permanent alimentary canal opens on the opposite
  surface. In <i>Pedicellina</i>, the one case in which the larval digestive organs are known to
  become those of the first adult individual, this presupposes a rotation of the alimentary canal,
  in order to bring it into its new position.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the larvae of other fixed animals may undergo a somewhat similar change.
  Thus those of Ascidians and of Barnacles fix themselves by their anterior end, and ultimately
  reach their adult form by performing a kind of a somersault. The process may perhaps be explained
  by supposing that some part of the anterior end or of the oral surface is specially sensitive, and
  that the larva fixes itself by that portion of its <span class="pagenum" id="page514"><span
  class="smaller">{514}</span></span>body which is best fitted for ascertaining which is the proper
  substance on which to fix.</p>

  <p><b>Budding</b>.&mdash;The formation of a new individual may take place by the outgrowth of part
  of the body-wall, as in <i>Pedicellina</i> (Fig. 243, p. <a href="#page487">487</a>) and in
  <i>Bowerbankia</i> (Fig. 238, p. <a href="#page480">480</a>). In <i>Pedicellina</i> a young stalk
  is formed by an outgrowth near one of the growing points, and the upper part of this outgrowth
  becomes constricted off to form the calyx. In other cases (cf. the growing ends of the branches in
  Fig. 237) a partition grows across the body-cavity at the growing edge of the colony, and so cuts
  off a part destined to become a new zooecium.</p>

  <p>The zooecium formed in one of these ways acquires an alimentary canal by the formation of a
  polypide-bud, some stages in the growth of which are shown in Fig. 235 (p. <a
  href="#page472">472</a>). Contrary to what happens in Coelenterates and Tunicates, in which the
  endoderm takes part in the budding, there is good reason for believing that in Polyzoa the
  polypide-bud is developed entirely from ectoderm and mesoderm.<a id="NtA_583"
  href="#Nt_583"><sup>[583]</sup></a> The bud is a two-layered vesicle, attached to the inner side
  of the body-wall. Its inner layer is derived from the ectoderm, which at first projects into the
  body-cavity in the form of a solid knob surrounded by mesoderm-cells. A cavity appears in the
  inner, ectodermic mass, and the upper part of the vesicle so developed becomes excessively thin,
  forming the tentacle-sheath, which is always developed in the condition of retraction. The lower
  part becomes thicker; its inner layer gives rise to the lining of the alimentary canal, to the
  nervous system, and to the outer epithelium of the tentacles, which grow out into the
  tentacle-sheath (cf. Fig. 235). The outer layer gives rise to the mesodermic structures, such as
  the muscles, connective tissue, and generative organs.</p>

  <p class="sp5">These processes are fundamentally similar, whether in the metamorphosed larva, in a
  young zooecium, in an old zooecium after the formation of a "brown body," or in the germinating
  statoblast of the Phylactolaemata.</p>

  FOR THE EXAMINATION OF SPECIFIC CHARACTERS&mdash;TERMINOLOGY&mdash;KEY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF
  THE GENERA OF BRITISH MARINE POLYZOA</span></p>

  <p>Our account of the Polyzoa would be manifestly incomplete without some reference to the
  systematic arrangement of these animals. An outline of the principal groups has been given on p.
  <a href="#page475">475</a>. So far, the classification is easy, but it is otherwise when we
  attempt to subdivide most of the groups any further.</p>

  <p>Systems of classification which depend exclusively upon the external characters of animals have
  been repeatedly shown to be unsatisfactory. Now with regard to the Polyzoa, not only is it the
  case that the great majority of forms are only known in their external characteristics, but
  current systems of classification cannot be regarded as final, because it is not yet certain which
  of the external features have most systematic value. Two obvious points can be at once
  selected&mdash;namely, the character of the zooecium and the character of the entire colony. One
  or two instances will serve to show what different results are obtained by depending exclusively
  on either of these characters by itself.</p>

  <p>According to the older writers, the habit of the colony was taken as the most important generic
  character; and there can indeed be no doubt that this feature has great importance within certain
  limits. Any one who has examined different species of such genera as <i>Flustra</i>,
  <i>Cellaria</i>, <i>Bugula</i>, <i>Retepora</i>, etc., must feel that the form of the colony goes
  for a good deal. But a consideration of other cases shows that there is great risk in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page516"><span class="smaller">{516}</span></span>indiscriminate use of this
  method of arranging the Polyzoa. The old genus <i>Eschara</i>, composed of forms with an erect
  coral-like habit,<a id="NtA_584" href="#Nt_584"><sup>[584]</sup></a> included species which are
  now placed in such different genera as <i>Lepralia</i>, <i>Porella</i>, <i>Microporella</i>, etc.
  The older works on Polyzoa include all encrusting forms of Cheilostomata, with a completely
  calcareous front wall, in the genus <i>Lepralia</i>, the members of which are now distributed in
  numerous widely separated genera.</p>

  <p>As an instance of the converse arrangement&mdash;essential similarity of the zooecia with great
  differences of the general habit&mdash;may be mentioned the common <i>Membranipora</i>
  (<i>Electra</i>) <i>pilosa</i>.<a id="NtA_585" href="#Nt_585"><sup>[585]</sup></a> Ordinarily
  growing in the form of close encrustations on seaweeds, this species may take on entirely
  different habits of growth. The zooecia are now dissociated, growing in single lines over the
  substratum; now forming erect tufts, composed of single lines of zooecia or of several rows. The
  erect, branching habit appears to be induced in the first instance by the character of the seaweed
  on which the colony begins life. Thus colonies which encrust the thin branches of <i>Corallina</i>
  may have impressed on them something of the mode of growth of the seaweed, so that when they
  extend beyond the tips of the branches of the <i>Corallina</i>, they continue to grow in delicate
  branches, which still retain more or less the same diameter as those which form their base. An
  extreme variation results in the beautiful form known as <i>Electra verticillata</i>, in which the
  zooecia are arranged with great regularity in whorls, which together form erect branches.<a
  id="NtA_586" href="#Nt_586"><sup>[586]</sup></a> But with all these variations, the zooecia are so
  much alike that it is hardly possible to regard the extreme forms as more than varieties of a
  single species. A careful examination of this case would convince most observers that the
  characters of the zooecium are a more trustworthy guide to classification than those of the entire
  colony, a result which was first clearly stated by Smitt, and amply confirmed by Hincks.<a
  id="NtA_587" href="#Nt_587"><sup>[587]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The avicularia of the Cheilostomata afford useful help in classifying this group; but while
  certain genera are always provided with avicularia, others include some species with these organs,
  and other species without them. Again, while the species <span class="pagenum" id="page517"><span
  class="smaller">{517}</span></span>of some genera (e.g. <i>Cellepora</i>) possess a great variety
  of forms of avicularia, the same pattern of avicularium may characterise several widely different
  genera. Further, the <i>position</i> of the avicularium may be very different in species which are
  apparently closely related. Well-developed vibracula, although constant in their occurrence in
  such forms as <i>Scrupocellaria</i> (Fig. 254) and <i>Caberea</i> (Fig. 242), occur here and there
  in species of encrusting forms which are ordinarily placed in very different families.</p>

  <p>Now although some of these discrepancies are perhaps due to errors in classification, whereby
  species which are really allied have been wrongly placed in distinct genera, this explanation
  would not prove satisfactory in all cases. Thus in <i>Bugula</i>, a genus which is specially
  characterised by the high development of its avicularia, these organs are normally absent in <i>B.
  neritina</i>. The fact that this species was rightly placed in the genus has been confirmed by the
  discovery made by Waters<a id="NtA_588" href="#Nt_588"><sup>[588]</sup></a> that avicularia occur
  in specimens which are believed to be identical with that species.</p>

  the <span class="sc">Flustrina</span>, to which belong <i>Flustra</i> (Fig. 232),
  <i>Membranipora</i> (Fig. 256, A, B), <i>Micropora</i> (Fig. 256, C), and other forms in which the
  front wall of the zooecium is either membranous, or depressed and marked off by a ridge-like
  margin; (C) the <span class="sc">Escharina</span>, including the great majority of forms, in which
  no part of the front wall remains membranous, the wall of the zooecium being wholly calcified.</p>

  <p>3. The Ctenostomata comprise (A) the <span class="sc">Alcyonellea</span> or encrusting forms;

  <p>Even this classification, which deals only with the larger groups, must not be made use of
  without a word of warning. The division of the Cheilostomata is a matter of great difficulty; and
  no scheme which has yet been suggested can be regarded as more than tentative. The great number of
  forms included in this group makes its subdivision extremely desirable from the point of view of
  convenience; but a further knowledge of the anatomy and of the development of many of the forms of
  doubtful systematic position is probably necessary before any scheme which is likely to be
  permanent is put forward. Those who desire to make a further study of the classification of the
  Polyzoa should refer to the works of Hincks,<a id="NtA_590" href="#Nt_590"><sup>[590]</sup></a>
  Busk,<a id="NtA_591" href="#Nt_591"><sup>[591]</sup></a> MacGillivray,<a id="NtA_592"
  href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a> and Gregory.<a id="NtA_593"
  href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Polyzoa do not appear to lend any valuable assistance towards settling the disputed
  problems of Geographical Distribution. They are not in any case terrestrial, while the fresh-water
  species do not always respect the limits between the great zoogeographical regions. It has already
  been pointed out (p. <a href="#page504">504</a>) that <i>Plumatella</i>, <i>Fredericella</i>, and
  <i>Lophopus</i> are believed to occur in Australia, and the first-named genus is practically
  world-wide in its distribution.</p>

  <p>Many marine forms also have a surprisingly wide distribution. Thus among the British species
  which are described by Mr. Hincks as occurring from Norway to New Zealand are <i>Membranipora
  pilosa</i>, <i>Scrupocellaria scruposa</i>, <i>Cellaria fistulosa</i>, <i>Microporella
  ciliata</i>, and <i>M</i>. <i>malusii</i>. Even if it should be proved that specific differences
  do exist between the southern forms and our own, there can be no doubt of the wide distribution of
  certain species. It was pointed out by D'Orbigny that <i>Bugula neritina</i> has the habit of
  attaching itself to the bottoms of ships, a fact which may possibly account for the wide
  distribution of this species; although it would not be safe to assume this explanation of the
  facts in all cases. Other Polyzoa, on the contrary, have a more restricted range. Thus
  <i>Catenicella</i> is specially characteristic of the Australian region.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps surprising that marine Polyzoa should in so many cases have so wide a range. Even
  though it is the rule <span class="pagenum" id="page520"><span
  class="smaller">{520}</span></span>for Polyzoa to have free larvae, the period during which these
  larvae are free-swimming is, so far as is known, a short one in most cases. <i>Cyphonautes</i> is
  a common pelagic form (see p. <a href="#page510">510</a>), and probably remains for a considerable
  period in the larval condition. Other Polyzoon-larvae appear to fix themselves very soon after
  their birth; and this would not appear to give much time for them to be carried to great distances
  by ocean-currents. It may, however, be suggested that it does not follow that because we know that
  a larva may, under favourable conditions fix itself a few minutes after it becomes free, we should
  be justified in assuming that that larva would not retain for a long period the power of
  undergoing a normal metamorphosis should it be drifted away from suitable fixing-grounds.</p>

  <p><b>Palaeontology</b>.<a id="NtA_594" href="#Nt_594"><sup>[594]</sup></a>&mdash;The number of
  fossil Polyzoa is enormous. D'Orbigny devoted two hundred plates and more than a thousand octavo
  pages<a id="NtA_595" href="#Nt_595"><sup>[595]</sup></a> to a Monograph on the Cretaceous Polyzoa
  of France. Many of the fossil forms are extraordinarily well preserved, and there is often no
  difficulty in recognising the identity between certain fossil species belonging to the more recent
  formations and living forms. It thus becomes necessary to consult Palaeontological memoirs in
  working at recent Polyzoa.</p>

  <p>While the great majority of fossil Polyzoa do not differ in any essential particular from
  recent species, this is not altogether the case with the Palaeozoic forms. Leaving out of account
  the Stromatoporoids, which have been variously referred to the Sponges, Hydrozoa, and
  Foraminifera, as well as to the Polyzoa, the Palaeozoic strata contain large numbers of peculiar
  Cyclostomata, together with members of the Trepostomata, a fourth Sub-order of Gymnolaemata,
  allied to the Cyclostomata. The Trepostomata are for the most part Palaeozoic, but a few survived
  as late as the Jurassic period.<a id="NtA_596" href="#Nt_596"><sup>[596]</sup></a> These, with the
  other Polyzoa from the same formations, are considered by Dr. Gregory in his recently published
  <i>Catalogue of the Fossil Bryozoa in the British Museum</i> (1896).</p>

  <p>The number of Polyzoa recorded from the earlier secondary strata is small. The majority of the
  known Jurassic forms <span class="pagenum" id="page521"><span
  class="smaller">{521}</span></span>belong to the Cyclostomata; and one or two Cheilostomes are
  recorded from the same period. Recent papers by Walford<a id="NtA_597"
  href="#Nt_597"><sup>[597]</sup></a> on Jurassic Polyzoa contain the description of genera which
  are believed to be intermediate between the Cyclostomata and Cheilostomata, particularly with
  regard to the characters of their ovicells. Although it is not impossible there may be a
  connection between the ovicells of these two groups, it has yet to be proved that the two sets of
  structures are homologous.</p>

  <p>The Cretaceous period marks the commencement of a large number of Cheilostome genera, although
  the Cyclostomes still remain numerous.</p>

  <p>In the Tertiary formations the Cyclostomes gradually become less numerous, and although in
  earlier geological periods they far outnumbered the Cheilostomes, these relations are now
  reversed. Certain Tertiary strata, and particularly the Coralline Crag (Pliocene), are remarkable
  for the extremely large number of Polyzoa they contain. It will be noticed that no mention has
  been made of the Entoprocta, the Ctenostomata, and the Phylactolaemata. Their absence in the
  fossil condition<a id="NtA_598" href="#Nt_598"><sup>[598]</sup></a> need not, however, be a matter
  for surprise, as none of these forms are so well suited for being fossilised as are the calcareous
  Cyclostomata and Cheilostomata. There is consequently no adequate reason for assuming that the
  absence of a palaeontological record implies that these groups have been recently evolved.</p>

  <p><b>Determination of Genera of Marine Polyzoa.</b>&mdash;The species to which a Polyzoon belongs
  can only be determined, in most cases, with the assistance of the low powers of a microscope.
  There are very great advantages in the use of a binocular instrument, by means of which a
  microscopic preparation appears with its parts standing up in proper relief.</p>

  <p>In the case of the calcareous forms, the external characters may be more readily made out in a
  dry preparation than in any other way. For this purpose, the colony should be washed with fresh
  water, in order to remove the salts, which otherwise crystallise out on drying and obscure the
  surface. Preparations of this kind must be looked at with the aid of reflected light.
  Canada-balsam or glycerine preparations are also valuable, whether <span class="pagenum"
  id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>stained or unstained; and are essential for
  the examination of the softer forms. In the case of erect species, both surfaces of the branch
  should be looked at. The opercula, avicularia, and rosette-plates afford important systematic
  characters in the case of the Cheilostomata.</p>

  <p>It must not be forgotten to take account of the condition of the zooecia at different ages. The
  old zooecia often become entirely altered in form, by the deposition of additional calcareous
  matter, or by the loss of certain parts present in the younger zooecia. Thus the marginal spines
  may be entirely lost in the older individuals, while in those forms which develop a "peristome"
  (see Fig. 255 and p. <a href="#page524">524</a>), the characters of the orifice can often be
  determined in the young zooecia only. It is thus essential to examine the growing ends of the
  branches or the rim of the colony, as the case may be.</p>

  <p>In order to make preparations with the tentacles expanded, hydrochlorate of cocaine, chloral
  hydrate or spirit should be added gradually to the water. When the animals are completely
  anaesthetised they may be killed by means of a 7-10 p.c. solution of sulphate of copper (best made
  in distilled water or in rain water). This method gives admirable results in the case of both
  <span class="pagenum" id="page523"><span class="smaller">{523}</span></span>fresh-water and marine
  Polyzoa.  The use of formaline (see p. <a href="#page229">229</a>) may be strongly recommended for
  the Vesicularina.</p>

  Recent Marine Bryozoa</i>.<a id="NtA_600" href="#Nt_600"><sup>[600]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Terminology.</b>&mdash;A few technical terms must of necessity be employed. The colony is
  <i>adherent</i> when its zooecia are attached to the object on which the colony is growing. The
  <i>zooecium</i> is the body-wall of a single individual; and, except in transparent species, is
  the only part which can be seen from the outside in the retracted condition of the <i>polypide</i>
  or tentacles with the alimentary canal. The outermost layer of the zooecium is known as the
  <i>ectocyst</i>; it may be simply membranous, or calcified, or may be rendered opaque by foreign
  bodies; its surface in <span class="pagenum" id="page524"><span
  class="smaller">{524}</span></span>calcareous forms is often marked by <i>pores</i> (Fig. 239, C,
  <i>p</i>), which are vacuities in the calcareous wall, closed externally by membrane. A special
  <i>median pore</i> (Fig. 241, A, <i>m.p</i>) may occur, and is in some cases at least a complete
  perforation through the body-wall.</p>

  <p>The tentacles are protruded through the <i>orifice</i>, which in Cheilostomata is usually
  guarded by a movable chitinous lid, or <i>operculum</i> (Fig. 256, A, <i>o</i>). Should the
  ectocyst be thickened or raised into a ridge surrounding the orifice, a tubular passage results,
  known as the <i>secondary orifice</i> (Fig. 255), at the deeper end of which is the true orifice.
  The <i>peristome</i> (Fig. 255, C, <i>pr</i>) is the raised or thickened part which gives rise to
  the secondary orifice. Should the zooecium be outlined by a raised ridge, the part so enclosed is
  known as the <i>area</i> (Fig. 256, C, <i>a</i>), if calcareous. The <i>aperture</i> or
  <i>opesia</i> (Fig. 256, A, B, <i>ap</i>) is a membranous part of the front surface; and may
  consist of the whole or part of the area. The orifice or the aperture is commonly provided with
  <i>spines</i> (Fig. 256, B, <i>s</i>).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 257.</span>&mdash;<b>A</b>, <i>Cribrilina annulata</i>
      Fabr., Norway, &times; 33; <i>c</i>, calcareous bars concealing the membranous aperture: <b>B</b>,
      <i>Membraniporella nitida</i> Johnst., Plymouth, &times; 45; <i>a</i>, calcareous bars growing up
      round the margin of the aperture; <i>b</i>, the same, further developed; <i>c</i>, the same,

      mature, ovicell; <i>s</i>, marginal spines.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>avicularium</i> and the <i>vibraculum</i> are specially modified zooecia (see p. <a
  href="#page482">482</a>), which occur in a great variety of forms, in certain Cheilostomata only.
  The operculum of the ordinary zooecium is represented by the <i>mandible</i> (Fig. 239, B,
  <i>m</i>) in the avicularium, and by the <i>seta</i> (Fig. 242, <i>s</i>) in the vibraculum. The
  representative of the zooecium itself is known as the <i>avicularian</i> (Fig. 239, A, <i>a.z</i>)
  or <i>vibracular zooecium</i> (Fig. 242, <i>v.z</i>).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page525"><span class="smaller">{525}</span></span></div>

  <p>An <i>ovicell</i> is a swelling in which the embryo develops, in certain Cyclostomata (Fig.
  237) and Cheilostomata (Fig. 241, A, <i>o</i>). A <i>stolon</i> (Fig. 238, B, <i>st</i>) is a
  stem, not formed of fused zooecia, from which new individuals originate. An <i>internode</i>, in a
  jointed colony, is the part between any two joints. The <i>fornix</i> or <i>scutum</i> (Fig. 254,
  A, <i>f</i>) is a modified spine which in some Cheilostomata overhangs the aperture. A
  <i>mucro</i> (Fig. 255, A, <i>mu</i>) is a spike or protuberance developed just below the orifice.
  A <i>sinus</i> (Fig. 239, B, <i>s</i>) is a slight bay on the lower margin of the orifice.</p>

  <p>The orifice opens at the <i>upper</i> end of the zooecium, on its <i>front</i> surface. The
  <i>length</i> of the zooecium is the distance from the upper to the lower ends, and the
  <i>width</i> the distance between its sides.</p>

  <p class="x-smaller"><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"There are very many, not only among educated people who
  take an interest in science, but even among specialists, who will welcome a work of reasonable
  compass and handy form containing a trustworthy treatment of the various departments of Natural
  History by men who are familiar with, and competent to deal with, the latest results of scientific
  research.... Altogether, to judge from this first volume, <i>The Cambridge Natural History</i>
  promises to fulfil all the expectations that its prospectus holds out."</p>

  <p class="x-smaller"><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"It can be read with profit by the zoologist,
  and there is a vast amount of matter which is interesting to those who like the tit-bits of
  science; but do not care so much for the more serious aspects of the subject."</p>

  <p class="x-smaller"><i>NATURE NOTES.</i>&mdash;"The work as a whole is thoroughly well got up,
  and we cordially recommend it to our readers."</p>

  <p class="x-smaller"><i>FIELD.</i>&mdash;"The work is really an admirable introduction to the
  study of molluscs, treating of their position in the animal kingdom, the habits and general
  economy of land and fresh-water species, their structure, general distribution over the earth's
  surface (which is illustrated by some very valuable maps), their growth and development, their
  uses to man, the cultivation for food of such species as the oyster, the mussel, and the snail,
  and the utilisation of their shells for money and ornament.... We know of no book available to the
  general reader which affords such a vast fund of information on the structure and habits of
  molluscs."</p>

    <p>A full account of Polyclad development is contained in Lang's "<i>Polycladen</i>," with
    references to the literature of the subject. Since the date of that work (1884) the embryology
    of Ctenophora has become better known, but, though the segmentation of the egg and early stages
    of development are very similar in both cases, the elaborate investigations of E. B. Wilson
    (<i>Journ. Morphology</i>, vol. vi. p. 361) show that the segmentation of Polychaet worms is
    again similar. The question of the affinities of the Polycladida is also discussed by Lang
    ("<i>Polycladen</i>" p. 642 <i>et seq.</i>). The work of the last decade has neither proved nor
    disproved his suggestion that the Ctenophores and Polyclads have been derived from common
    ancestors. On this subject the remarks made by Hatschek (<i>Lehrbuch d. Zoologie</i>, p. 319)
    are some of the weightiest that have appeared.</p>

    <p>Gosse's account of the "Structure, Functions, and Homologies of the Manducatory Organs in the
    Class Rotifera" (in <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1856) remains as the most complete anatomical account we
    have, though his attempt to identify these parts with the modified limbs of the Arthropod mouth
    has met with no support from subsequent workers. Gosse rendered these parts clearly visible by

    <p>The classification we have adopted is a modification of that made by Hudson and Gosse; we
    have divided up their first Order Rhizota into two, and split off from Flosculariidae the family
    Apsilidae; removed the Asplanchnaceae from the admittedly heterogeneous Order Ploima, made
    distinct families in the Ploima for Microcodonidae and Rhinopidae, and created a third new Order
    for the Seisonaceae. Ehrenberg, Gosse, and Hudson, being the authors of most of the genera, are

    <p>Closely allied is <i>Manayunkia</i> Leidy, which occurs in fresh-water lakes of America.
    Another fresh-water genus is <i>Coabangia</i> Giard, which perhaps deserves the creation of a
    special family. The anus is ventral and anterior. The chaetae are peculiarly arranged, dorsal
    uncini being present only on four segments. The first body segment carries a ventral bundle of
    five great "palmate" chaetae.</p>

    <p>Whitman quotes with regretful approval (<i>Proc. Americ. Acad.</i> xx. 1884-85, p. 76) Sir J.
    Dalyell's remark, "It does not appear that the history of the leech has advanced in proportion
    to the number of <i>literati</i> who have rendered it the subject of discussion," and adds on
    his own account the following severe indictment of his predecessors: "As a considerable share of
    the work done in this direction is purely systematic, it is somewhat surprising that not a
    single description of any Hirudo has been given with sufficient accuracy and completeness for a
    close comparison of even its more important external characters with those of other
    species."</p>

    <p>But Pennant in his <i>British Zoology</i> has referred to a leech which is even larger. Upon
    the huge Basking shark (<i>Selache</i>) the fishermen sometimes observe a leech, which
    invariably drops off when the fish is brought to the surface, "of a reddish colour and about 2
    feet in length"; this may be a <i>Pontobdella</i>.</p>

    <p>The account given in the following pages has been deliberately restricted, for the most part,
    to British species. Our own fauna contains an assemblage of Polyzoa which is so representative
    that it has seemed better to do some justice to the British forms than to attempt to cover the
    whole ground in the limited number of pages devoted to this group. Those who desire to make a
    wider study of the subject should refer, for marine forms, to Busk's <i>Catalogue of Marine</i>
    <i>Polyzoa in the Collection of the British Museum</i>, Parts I.-III. 1852, 1854, 1875; to the
    <i>Challenger</i> Reports on Polyzoa, Parts 30 (1884), 50 (1886), and 79 (1888); for references
    and lists of species, to Vine's <i>Report on Recent Marine Polyzoa, Cheilostomata and
    Cyclostomata</i> (Report, 55th meeting Brit. Ass. Aberdeen, 1885, pp. 481-680); [and to Nickles
    and Bassler, <i>Synopsis Amer. Foss. Bryozoa incl. Bibliography</i> (Bull. U.S. Geol. Survey,
    No. 173, 1900)]. References to the literature of the fresh-water forms will be found below, in
